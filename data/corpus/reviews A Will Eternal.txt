COMEDY+CULTIVATION+TRAGEDY+AWESOME WORLD-BUILDING+SHINING ARCH ENEMIES+ A POSER MC==== A WILL ETERNAL.TLDR-  TOTALLY WORTH YOUR TIME. :) (@-@)I have enjoyed this novel a lot, so much that it is one of the few novels for which i took the initiative to go and read the Machine Translation of the original work.Guys, this novel is a legend at Wuxiaworld.com.CHARACTER- The character, each of them, from the MC to the villains, have a role to play and not a superficial one but something that adds into the story.You must have heard that famous writers say that if something does not contribute to  your novel when writing a about a character or similarly for any other plot device, remove it. But here, each dot is connected and something which happend in the past may come back to haunt your present.STORY-  As i have completed the novel as it was going on, i can fully assure you, my dear reader, that the story is lucid and smooth, and it has tragedy and political intrigue in it, the tag is not for decoration purposes and attention-seeking.The  MC has path full of thorns which he crosses leaving behind roses of blood into the ground which bloom into the night sky.WORLD-BUILDING--- In the starting of this novel, you may feel a bit off(very tiny bit, as the sect in itself something very different from other typical cultivation sect) but i assure you that the world here, is actually massive and contributes hugely to the progression of character and the story.I assure you that it is worth your time.

I would say A Will Eternal is one of the classics which I stuck through thick and thin.It has one of my favorite main characters to date. His fear of death and pain grounds him to reality and relatability. Sometimes there are too straight-laced or serious main characters that feel bland or boring. Well not this one, The main character Bai Xiaochen is bursting with his personality.Speaking of him, we have a colorful cast as Er Gen novels. He has a habit of pushing minor characters back into the spotlight for a while especially in the latter half which has a satisfying feeling to it.It has been a while since I read this so I may have my biases but all in all it's a great comic novel that had me laughing as much as surprisingly tense and serious moments that tug my heartstrings.While as I've said it's mostly a comedy novel but it has moments that pumps your blood as you yell and shout along with the characters in their life and death struggle.I strongly recommend this to veteran readers and newcomers.

This novel will CRACK YOU UP!!!Extremely hilarious, funny, innocent and entertaining!! Not to mention you have the legendary translator Deathblade who did a really fantastic job on this. (Also translated 'I shall seal the heavens' on the same website which is a prequel to this one in the timeline. Another must-read novel)Er Gen's novels just get better and better.Never a dull moment in this one fellow Daoists. MC's antics , his behavior and character will have you grinning at all times. Last I heard they are even doing an anime on this soon. So whatchu waitin for? So buckle your seats and dive right in!! You'll thank me later.

This is one of Er Gen novels. Most of the other novels of Er Gen are a bit on the darker side. But this one is light hearted with lots and lots of comedy in it.Talking about characters, the story is almost from the point of view of the Hero. In the beginning, the hero is very relatable (i understand the irony of this sentence), but as the story progresses, he is a typical xianxia hero. The other characters don't have that much of a development, but it doesn't matter. The comedy will pull you through the whole story.Harem - YES.There is a solid story line developed from the very beginning and it keeps you engaged for the most part. There are a bit of repetitions here and there, but that won't be a problem.All said, I will put it under should give it a try till chapter 200 - if you are not convinced by then, it is not your cup of tea. I will say this though - it is a typical xianxia story (this is one of the old novels, so the word typical should't apply here) but very funny with lots of interesting characters and  villains with the main star  star being the hero.

the MC of this novel had me laughing out loud from start to finish. Sometimes it is very difficult being so excellent. If you liked I shall seal the heavens you will likely love a will eternal.I can’t really emphasis how funny this novel really is, maybe the funniest on Wuxiaworld.The world is pretty clearly laid out and the MC stays faithful to their ultimate obsession, to live forever and not lose his poor little life. Like some of Er Gens works you will see some Cameo appearances in this novel as well. If I could pick any novel to read on wuxiaworld, hands down it is this one

tl;dr - Read it.This right here is a fun ride all the way through, praise Er Gen for crafting this gem and to Death blade for bringing it to our shores. You best know that once you take the bait you'll be hooked right in without regrets. And godammit you'll be served many a laugh, you'll not believe just how many.It has everything you could want in a wuxia novel and even something's you didn't know you needed slapped right on top to keep you invested.When all is said and done, you can't just take my word for it. You owe it to yourself to read what I'd call a new classic. Take a read, there's no need to thank me later.

This is a story that I always come back to try reading, but then get started at a super cringe arc. This has a lot of thoseAt times it actually has me laughing out loud, then other times shaking my head wondering just how low the story can go and how ignorant the other characters can be.I would recommend it, but if you are anything like me it will be a slow read. I will also say that this is not a reflection on the translator. This series had very few typos, and the flow is translated so well that I could easily believe it read originally English.

Completely worth reading. Actually all of 耳根 work is amazing. This one will have you snorting more often than others since it's the least tragic of his works. I have actually read this one twice because it's so funny. His manipulation of prose, the awkwardness of innumerable situations, the translator's skills in actually getting that across fluidly has much to commend it. This, of course, is related to the other AMAZING books "I Shall Seal the Heavens" &amp; "Renegade Immortal" which you should also read! Many hours of joyous reading are predicted in your future if you embark upon this journey!TLDR : Read it

This book is unbelievably hilarious.I must have read this book around 3 times, on a regular rotation throughout the year, for a simple reason.The book is one of the funniest things I have ever read. Every time I re-read this book, I am always trapped inside a cycle of hysterical laughing until its half-past-3 in the morning, and I'm having too much fun to even imagine sleeping.The action is intense, the characters are very relatable, villains entertaining, and the main character.....Oooooooooooooooohhhh the main character. He's too much of a legend to explain here, and I shan't spoil it for you. But prepare for laughs, and prepare to see real character growth from the beginning of the book to the end.If I needed to pay 500 dollars to read this book again, I would start saving immediately. This book is a must read. And I cant praise it enough.

Nice. In general the story line is well developed, the foundation is really told and rarely contradictory.But sometimes there are still repetitions that are unnecessary or out of place, so it's as if the author itself that needs to be reminded, not the reader.And the typical story of Xianxia, ​​when the main character has reached or almost reached its highest cultivation point, the story line goes quickly so that sometimes forgetting details and other supporting figures that have been raised and mentioned before.The novel is not boring even though it is read over and over again, and presents a different level of cultivation (though essentially similar). Good jobs.

Er Gen's work might be good on its own but I think the translation efforts elevate these novels, especially by cutting down on repetition, which is still a bit prevalent. You nailed it again Deathblade, congratulations.AWE is awesome storywise and brings us a comedy prone MC but in a good way. Meng Hao from ISSTH is the middle-term and Wang Lin from RI the darkest take.Er Gen really manages to bestow upon his worlds a sense of character development and consistency. Whether you are new to Er Gen or have enjoyed some of his previous works here I highly recommend the journey through AWE.

I have read many many MANY novels on WXW and other websites. And this one stands out the most to me. Heck, this is the first novel I’m reading for the second time.The reason why this novel is so memorable is that it is so different from your usual xianxia novel. The MC and support cast are great and really fleshed out. Well actually... the MC can be a bit polarizing. I sometimes find myself not knowing whether to laugh or cry at the MC. He’s not your regular OP kick as MC, but a stupid brilliant idiot at times. In the beginning I was a bit put off by his quirkyness. But later on, I grew fond of it and was lmao-ing hard at times in public (looking just as idiotic as the MC).The author is able to deliver so much in terms of humor. Seems like ISSTH served as a basis for this novel and for this one, the author decided to go all out on humor. Which I really appreciate.The support cast is great as well. Rarely felt left out or put aside when MC powers up. Their interaction makes this novel feel really fleshed out.In terms of humor and character interaction, definitely among the best. World building, fights and suspense is great as well.Definitely a highly recommend from me. However, I do suggest reading other mainstream novels before starting this one, as this one is quite different from the rest.

My rating: 7/10This story is a bout a kid who's lost his parents that manages to step into the world of cultivation. His greatest strength (and weakness) lies in his talent for pill Dao which he will use to help forge his path forwards. He is a troubled young kid due to the fact that he lost his parents at an early age, something that caused him to develop PTSD. He deals with it by trying to make friends and be happy but at first is unsuccessful. He will manage to defeat his trauma over time by making good friends and through hard work. He is obsessed by the Pill Dao, so much so that he does a little more damage with it than good.The story is pretty good. It has the typical things wuxia novels have: a need to get stronger, entering a sect, cultivating, tournaments, pill concoction, going through dangerous places/dungeons/realms, encountering/making dangerous enemies. The cycle repeats for most of the novel. The thing that sets this novel apart is that its written well and the biggest + goes to that fact that there's plenty of comedy in it. And you will laugh because there's a lot of funny stuff.The Main Character(MC) is a bit dumb, makes questionable decisions, gives dumb names to things(really dumb names), always manages to mess up when concocting pills but the way he does it is silly and always gets a laugh. This is without a doubt the greatest strength of this novel and it's done very well.The side characters are pretty bland with the exception of a few (which are good). The world is large and interesting although it's not focused on so much and the factions are typical. (Btw, if you read I Shall Seal The Heavens you will get a "Woooah!" moment or two.)Overall its a good novel with lots of laughs and i do recommend it!

One of the best. Er Gen knows how to impliment unforeseen plottwists with genius.Comedic twists are genius.Seriousness included, so it all doesn't seem like a farce.The ending was satisfying which is just way too rare.I read the whole novel and all 1000 + chapters in about 2 months. It was a complete binge on my part .It all boils down to 100% pure genius.If you have read the likes of desolate ēra , Coiling dragon , warlock of the magus world or issth then this novel is for you.If this novel doesn't satisfy you I don't know what will.

Recommended, pretty good read in general, it has a lot of funny moments and recurring jokes.The mc has his own "thing", some mcs in other books are generic or change depending on the author's mood of the day they write, this is not the case since the mc is pretty consistent though he grows gradually.My only complaint is that in terms of numbers I would have rated this an 8/10, but later on some things that I didn't like appeared suddenly and weren't there in the beginning:Dragged on fights (not just the mc but also secondary characters)A certain enemy boss that gave me aids for some reasons I won't go in since it would be spoilers and other characters later introduced.the plot got weak near the end for me

The humor in this book is very strong. It reminded me of the book duke of the mount deer by jin yong. But it is not just humor. It also have lots of proper battle scene, and touching acts.The romance part is also quite strong.however, it is split into many woman. And sometime, you will not realize that someone is a potential romance partner, and bam, you realized they are.Although the book is long, it was not filled up with filler, and there is no rushed level increase like many other books.This is one of my favorite er gen novel. The other one is i shall seal the heaven, which is more serious, and have only one female lead.

You see this book. This is the best of the best of The very best book I’ve read on Wuxia World. Damn. This book was everything. The only thing I disliked was the ending. But Bai Xiaochun is the best MC ever. Cliches come in here and there but just because of the MC it becomes so funny and easy to read. I highly recommend this book. Buy it if need be. I’ve read it thrice now and I still laugh at the same things. The MC is powerful and yet so human. This novel is indeed a legend on Wuxia world. After reading this novel, then maybe Issth every other novel on WW becomes meh. I highly recommend this novel. It it can be a physical copy. I’ll purchase it and give to my children. It makes a great story book

The only novel on this website to have truly made me laugh out loud multiple times in glee. The action, plot, world building etc is all first-class also. Let’s just leave it at that.

A hilarious xianxia light novel that manages to have an excellent and intriguing plot despite having a focus on comedy.This story comes as a breath of fresh air, in that this main character isn't a struggler that has to fight through constant betrayal and treachery, but a silk-pants chosen of the sect who is favoured by the heavens. Many of the jokes in the story target cliches in the xianxia genre, making them particularly amusing to anyone which has read other xianxia novels (particularly I Shall Seal The Heavens and Renegade Immortal).A Will Eternal also supports an excellent cast of recurring characters, each with their own personalities which develop and have a good level of depth. How they relate to each other, and how the main character interacts with them can often be as heartwarming as it is hilarious, resulting in it being very easy to become attached to each and everyone of them.Ultimately, A Will Eternal is a journey that will pull the reader along with it, and if you're like me, you'll end up enjoying every moment of it.

This is actually my first Er Gen novel. I regret not listening to the guys at discord saying I start from RI but despite that mistake I enjoyed the whole plot specially the latest chapters showing how the author knows how to properly deliver the MCs growth and character development! Also, somewhat a light story sometimes too much but when you feel like it is too much it will change pace so no problem with that you won't even feel tired reading it since it is constantly like a roller coaster ride playing with our emotions! Hahahaha. Off to the next er gen novel! 10/10

One of my favorite novels. Probably in my top 3 and also probably the only harem novel that I would put up with because I love the MC so much.Story starts out really strong from chapter 1, and continues being pretty strong up until the 500s. Then there's a clear decline, as pacing gets much faster and it feels like the story is rushed even though Er Gen said it was his plan to finish it early. That being said even the declining second half I would say is much better than several of the novels out there. And by declining I mean the story gets slightly repetitive, certain tropes are re-used and MC starts to blow through cultivation stages. That being said still pretty humorous and interesting. I also really liked the last 10-20 chapters and how the story ended.I would recommend EVERYONE read this masterpiece. If not for any other reason do it for the comedy. I wish I could forget this novel so I could read it again because the sheer amount of times where I was laughing non-stop makes me miss reading this novel every day. To this day I haven't found a replacement in my daily reading as this is the funniest novel I have ever read, and a very interesting read.Deathblade is also a great translator, who is not only consistent but also very thorough and detailed in his translations making the translation top quality.

Definitely one of the best I've read so far. Never failed to make me laugh. The ending was very well-written. Overall, a solid 9.5/10. Would be a 10 if it had a sequel. Looking forward to reading Er Gen's other books. A a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a

Fantastic read. Funny, silly, clever and well written. From start to late late on it's constantly entertaining and I have rarely laughed so much out loud. The MC is just wonderful. The relationships are great and touching and there is minimal dumb reasons for confrontation. The MC is not some dao seeking ubermensch but a normal seeming dude who is a bit of a coward with a bottom line where he gets serious. The last sections drop off to me, but provide a clear and intelligent ending. I just have never really read much which manages to pull off the the ultimate levels of cultivation. So it's not even really a big criticism, just that it loses a lot of what made it so great.Before that though it's just wonderful, engaging funny read it.

This was fucking amazing!AWE is hilarious, I don't think I've ever laughed this hard for a novel, and our pure little MC, Bai Xiaochun is incredibly entertaining to watch.We also see Little Bai grow up, but never losing his original personality, which is refreshing as I've seen MCs from other novels losing their original personality and becoming mindless robots. Just picture a more shameless Meng Hao, who instead of loving money, loves life.With the snap of a finger, I, Daoist Edelgarde, have reduced this comment section to ashes.TLDR; I would heavily suggest this, and any of Er Gen's other novels.

This was one of the first Chinese novels I ever read so I might be a bit biased, but this is by far the best novel I have read on this site. There is plenty of character development and unlike some other novels, I can’t think of any important side characters being forgotten or left out. The only thing I’d say is not as well done is the romance but everything else is top notch. The novel also includes scenes of humor so it never gets boring. What I liked the most would be that nothing seems forced, there is no lvl 100 plot armor where the main character just suddenly becomes overpowered because he has to be.

Quite literally my favourite novel on the site.Some good humour, plenty of action and very little filler. It even has the bonus of sounding nuts when you summarise each ark to its main events with no context that highly enjoy.I even used this novel as an intro to wuxia to a few people who never heard of this genre before and they got hooked.It does however have some harem elements but this were extremely minor overall which is good as I hate this common Wuxia trait.As this author improves may his work be eternal.Great work and nice progress.

This is an Er Gen classic, so I went into this expecting greatness, and it delivered for sure.Our MC has a dynamic personality, and can be both somewhat of a coward or the bravest of souls. He is very lovable as he is always willing to make new friends and sacrifice himself for existing ones.All the characters in this novel grow together, its not just the MC.To prove my point is a minor spoiler: One of the villains isn't even defeated by the MC, rather one of his friends. Yet another reason to love this novel.Also many bits of comedy thrown in will keep you hooked.

Even though I am only 54 chapters into the novel the main characters is already one of my favorites. I hesitated to read this novel because I heard many people criticizing it for focusing on comedy over plot but I am glad that they were wrong. This main character has an actual reason for cultivating and is different from the protagonists who only start cultivating to get revenge on those that wronged them and save their comrades. Bai Xiaochun has an interesting set of ethics that makes me root for him more than I root for any other protagonist from the novels on wuxiaworld.

Rating : 8 out of 10One of the funniest and the most favourite LN that I have read so far.If you have read er gen other novel ISSTH, you will notice that Er Gen likes to have an obsessed MC, meng hao was on getting rich and on this AWE MC is obsessed in becoming an immortal. The author calls it dao path.ThingS that set this novel apart:Pretty short story- so not that many repetitives storyVery funny story- i can not think any other LN that is as funny as this one. I was chuckling when i wrote this as i remember some of the funny scenesEnding is alright. Most of the LN has pretty crap ending, this one is alright.Have a read and you wont regret it.

Often found myself laughing out loud, sometimes uncontrollably, sometimes to the point of thigh-pounding. Never have I so thoroughly enjoyed seeing the MC encounter misfortune in alchemy.Warning: Somewhat adult humorIt's really not your typical cultivation novel. Although many occurrences and cycles are similar (fight, lack strength, power up, fight again/face-slap cycles) the non-typical MC turns a lot of these things into, as the story said, "bizarre and amusing" situations.Also helps that I really like turtles. Early on in the first few chapters, the moment he put the turtle shell on his back, I knew I liked the MC. He still had issues that annoyed me to no end, but his sensible manner and protective nature had me liking him a lot at first.But after the first 1200+ chapters or so, it starts to get weird, and then it just gets weirder and weirder until, by the end of the book, the whole thing just feels wrong... Er Gen seems to have that same problem in his other books too.

Just read it. If your reading this just read it. This is what all Chinese Kung fu cultivator nonsense novels should strive to be. I had never laughed and cried over book until reading this, and haven’t since. Just read it. Here, I’ll give you a glimpse into the genius into this book with just two words: Sex Bomb. He makes a sex bomb. Go read it. Please go read it. I beg you go read it. You need to go read it. This has to be a 100 words so again I ask you to go read it. Go read it. Finally, done.

this is an incredible books it contains great action scenes amazing characters and over arching enemies that actually seem like a threat the mc is hilarious and the comedy is something that I've rarely seen in all of the donhua's I've read so far. i would recommend this  100%  as this is an amazing novel you should read it in your spare time as  I believe that the attention to detail made by the writers really allow me to enjoy it and I'm just writing the rest of this to get my karma points cmon hurry up three more words.

One of the best novel. The writer is er gen who is like god. You can compare him to oda of onepiece and siu of god of tower. His books are differents. Every novel he has wtitten it is different. If you look at some famous novelist. he will write same novel again and again but this guy is diiferent. He write every novel in a different way.His work include i shall seal the heaven which is probably my first novels i read along with atg , tales of god and demons, panglong etc. What i like about him is he will comlete the novel not just extend too much. Take the atg and tales of demons and gods(these novel has not finished yet.)

Awesome so far! Funny style of writing, especially when the author repeats Xiaochun's signature lines. Highly recommend it! Especially for new readers. I have read a lot of xianxias but this is the most entertaining one. I also like that it isn't too sexual. These days, stories add a lot of sex just to attract readers. But this novel is entertaining enough not to rely on that. MC has a good but interesting character too. He is so afraid to die, but when he sees his friends in danger, he will immediately change to a brave and valiant character. A must read for everyone!

It's amazing. It's been a year or more since I last read it but it's still one of my favorites.BXC is not your typical MC, well yes he does get OP, BUT he's so carefree and amiable he makes you smile and chuckle while reading of his antics.The story itself is a comedy but it doesnt lack a bit of angst and there was an arc where the author portrayed horror so well it got me goosebumps. Anyways, it's worth reading and a refreshing breath of air after all those clichesGive it a try and gope you enjoy it too

I recommend you to read a very funny and adventurous book.It was one of the most beautiful novels I have ever read. I think it is a humorous book that you will not be bored with reading. Thank you very much for the author's health and, of course, the opportunity to read on the site in his translation. Ben ingilizce bilmedigim icin elimden bu kadari geliyor umarim bu yorumu begenirsiniz hepinize iyi okumlar dilerim kesinlikle okurken sikilmiyacaksiniz ben su anda turkiyeden okuyorum kitabi siddetle tavsiye olunur bence omurde bir kere gelen guzel kitaplardan birisi er genin eline saglik byyyy kg

This novel is absolutely HILARIOUS and will definitely be read repeatedly. The MC has quickly become one of my most favorite fictional characters. I can't even express how funny yet exasperating he is.  He is an endearing attention seeker who somehow causes disasters where ever he goes. The supporting cast of characters are also quite likeable. I adored everything in this story, even the cringe worthy parts and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to laugh for hours and hours unend."When I get pissed off, I frighten even myself!""Ai. I really am just too outstanding.""I'm finished. Kaput."

This is the best novel I have read so far. What makes it so good is the fact that it is different, in the sense that cultivation and powering up is secondary.The MC is a problematic dude, whose fear to death will put him in all kind of funny situations. The story is smooth and I never found a hole in the story. On the contrary, it is extremely well though out and the translator did an excellent job. The pertinent and credible evolution of the MC makes this novel very delectable for picky readers that hate plot holes.I totally recommend it if you are looking for a light novel to laugh and have a good time.Up to the end I never felt like stop reading it!

A will of Eternal is a masterpiece!! I really enjoyed reading this novel, as it is funny, advantegous, romantic and action driven. Different from Immortal Renegade, the MC really grows together with his sect and you can follow the flourishing development of his character from a child to a brave adult who protects everyone he cares about. wonderful worlds, building territory, great enemies and side characters. Moreover, it doesnt get confusing about the location and events happening to the MC, which happen quite often in Chinese martial arts novels. It is funny and some jokes will make you laugh out loud! Wonderful written and good translation!Highly recommended!!

One of my favourite novels on WW. It's one of er-gen's best, it's light-hearted, the main character is hilarious, situational and very, very enjoyable.As opposed to most novels, where the MC is a copy pasted repeat of the same character who's always glib tongued, cool, aloof and serves bad guys their just deserts, Bai Xiao Chan is a coward who thinks mainly of himself and how to get out of trouble, constantly talks himself up to feel proud, yet he still somehow gathers friends along the way. His journey to immortality started from an incense from an immortal he was too scared to light up since it called up lightning every time he did, and from there it just get more and more hilarious. Sounds dumb, but it's truly one of the best novels on site.

Er Gen striked again with another spectacular novel. As usual in Er Gen novels, the world and characters of the story even outside of the MC Bai Xiaochun are well crafted and memorable, however what really makes this story exceptional is the MC, whose whimsical and trouble-provoking personality is hilariously fun to read about. The MC's reason for cultivating is relatable yet laughable and different to other cultivation novels. While having strong comedic values, the novel also has moments or seriousness regarding tragedy and the state of the cultivator world, coupled with adeptly written fights giving a good contrast of feelings to the reader. Do read!

I have read a lot of webnovels, a low ball estimate of about 15. And of all those novels A Will Eternal is my favourite. This novel has ticked every single box for me.Main Character: Genuinely relatable.Unlike most novels, the MC isn't a emotionless machine. He is a human who has a rich personality that changes over time. I can actually care about the MC and his struggles.Comedy: God level.This is the funniest webnovel I have read. The MC and situations his antics get him into, are creatively and naturally funny.Plot and pacing: Actually planned.This author planned his entire story before writing it. So there are no parts of the story that are unnecessary and boring. And the way everything ties together at the end is satisfying.World and cultivation system: Original and integrated.I like that the way the cultivation system is tightly connected to the world. Every detail seems well thought out, and part of a whole..Action: Suprisingly suspenseful and engaging.The novel knows when to turn down the comedy and up the stakes, when there are serious battles. All battles are well composed and creative.Romance: Not cancerous.This isn't a romance novel, and it doesn't try to be. Expect comedy.I am in awe at how awesome AWE is. It is a top tier webnovel. 10/10.

A hilarious and likable protagonist who wants what the whole immortality bit.  No, not cultivating to higher levels, not being strongest, just like it says on the tin - living forever.I recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys cultivation type novels - give it a few chapters, you'll know very quickly if its your jam since this novel was written with a set number of chapters in mind and has no filler whatsoever.Unlike this review who has to reach 100 words to post and has to put down a few more words to reach the minimum.Limit. Limit. words.

Absolutely hilarious and one of the most enjoyable books on Wuxiaworld!  Bai Xiaochun is very unique as far as main characters are concerned; I honestly don't think I've read a cultivation novel with a more shameless, ridiculous lead than this.  This book does contain some emotional moments, for sure, but overall it's so funny that you're going to have a smile on your face pretty much the whole time you're reading it.  Hmm, apparently I need to get to 100 words...  One of the things I wish the story had was a bit more screen time for Bai Xiaochun's turtle sidekick.  He was such a fun addition to the story that I would have like a bit more personally, but that's not really  a complaint, just a thought I had to get the word count up. ;)

My second ever Xianxia and I have to admit I enjoyed it so much, I’m worried I may have read this book too early and set my standards too high. As the main character was so lovable and funny, a nice change from my first Xianxia Against the Gods. I highly recommend it with a very good and unique ending that won’t leave you disappointed. Now we can only hope that we may get a little treasure continuation. (Joking)The book is wonderfully pieced together, my only criticism is that some of the big fights feel a little dragged out but that is minor and I’m sure most would feel differently. Definitely give it a try.

This novel is so much fun! I was laughing/crying/anxious throughout the whole novel. No part is wasted! It is definitely the most lighthearted novel on the site that I have so far read.The best thing about this novel is the MC. I will not spoil anything but he definitely cracked me up so many times while I read/reread this. His character is very likeable/loveable and you just want more of him! (Sequel please?)Among all the books by the same author on the site, I would say I love this the most. Will very likely buy this book in the future!Solid 10/10!

You will not regret reading AWE.Starts of so funny and comedy is sustained for a long time.The author uses serious situations as the setting for scenes of comedy. A breath of fresh air compared to most reads.Author did a great job and the translator made reading AWE a breeze.Most characters  were well developed and it's a shame that a few got forgotten along the way.No one would regret reading AWE.I have never read about an MC such as this! He is disaster walking on two legs with a sign on his forehead in neon lights no one can miss.Author did a Great job.

Thoroughly enjoying this book, I discovered it in Sept, 2020 and since then I've decided to join VIP just to read it everyday, so its also a bit of a distraction, every free moment I have, I'm looking forward to reading this book. Already at Chapter 900 and struggling to put it down but also don't want to reach the end...really hilarious, MC is definitely in a league of his own in when it comes to his thought processes for survival. So many one liners that i just love...Keep wishing it was in anime or movie everytime I picture his mistakes while concocting pills etc...You have to read AWE, definitely worth purchasing to reread for some laughs...Thank you Er Gen and Deathblade!!!

READ THIS NOW ITS SO VERY WORTH YOUR TIME FELLOW DAOIST.Now that the most important thing is out of the way lets get to the details and fill out my word count!.Point1: The storys world building and history all matter and will never be forgotten like some other books on the site.Point2: All side characters matter from the moment they are introduced and all have important impact and use in the story!.Point3: The over arching story flows nicely and feels good to read, everything is enjoyable and has you clicking for the next chapter instantly.Point4: it covers so much goodness in one tight package that i  wish i could spoil the entire story for you. I read this and i can recount how awesome one of the earliest chapters were the same way I can recount the very last. Its just perfect.Point5: No cultivation peak form 994 power levels , where a new one is made every 100 chapters to explain how they can get more powerful and how a new powerful villian is there who is suddenly already all powerful. Just a great cultivation system expected of ErGens works!.Please read this, id love to say more but my words cannot give it proper justice.

My favorite novel. When I started reading this I expected a generic, cliché novel but WOW was I surprised. This is my favorite novel, there is barely any plot-holes and if there are then the author usually resolves them really early or very late in the novel. This is my first Er Gen novel and I'm definitely gonna read the rest of his novels. I just don't like how the ending is with unresolved answers, like what happened to the worlds he created, does he go to the Never-Ending Dao Domain. The start is good but can get annoying since the MC is a cowardice and the comedy is good but can be overused. The MC does get over his cowardice every now and then. At first you'll hate that about the MC but after a while it gets better and the novel gets more interesting.

Hands up one of the best series that I have read in a long while since the Coiling Dragon,Stellar Transformations and I shall seal the heavens, probably if not the best it's up there   I loved everything especialy the comedy is gold , I laughed my ass reading how the protagonists toys with his enemies and allies alike I wish I had friends to share this novel with but no one seems to like reading in my circle of friends or family well they are losing out :) . Don't even doubt reading this it starts a bit slow at start and the protagonist seems a bit cowardly but it gets way better as he grows and goes through trials of fire  I also recommend watching the anime of this novel it gets even better

This is one of the best novels on this site, even though I don't like other work of Er Gen. Story is fluid, well developed, with reach characters. Fair amount of comedy is very nicely integrated in to story line as well.Personally, I love the MC. He is very realistic and afraid of dying but wants to live forever and works hard toward his ultimate goal.Unfortunately (for some readers) there is not much of harem here, but still worth your time.I should have picked up this novel right after ISSH but I still enjoyed it and did not skip any chapters ;-)

It’s a decent enough series, I really enjoyed the MC’s character. He also had a very contradictory essence to him, it showed on multiple occasions. I’m going to say spoilers from here on, so leave if you want to avoid them.After the “ascension” I feel like the story just goes to a more “classical” wuxia novel where it’s a super linear progression and the MC’s character becomes far more bland. He loses that contradictory essence to him and ultimately even his women turn into docile little lambs when they had previously been fierce. Not to mention there are quite a few plot lines that are seemingly abandoned completely lol. Also prior to the ascension all the effort in acquiring the Heaven Dao path is worthless lol, he literally is given a Dao path that is of the “highest” tier from a “dieing” man, but its just so ridiculous. The ending is extremely convoluted, and he goes to another cultivation universe but he’s also not beyond the peak of their cultivation universe even though he supposedly inherited the Allheaven title and is the creator of all life but that doesn’t put him at the peak of all life?? it’s like wtf wtf wtf. very very disappointing ending.

Rating: 9/10One of the best novels I've read on this sight. A Will Eternal is a great mix of action, suspense, mystery and comedy ( a LOT of comedy) all in one.The main character, unlike a lot the other stories, has an actual personality beyond being the chosen one which makes it more enjoyable to see him succeed and easier care about him when he doesn't.I would say the strongest aspect of the story is the unpredictability. Although it can seem a bit formulaic at times the writer always manages to find a way to surprise the reader creating some of the wackiest and out of the box solutions for problems in the story.

Out of all of the chinese novels in wuxia world AWE is the one i love the most, because unlike the other chinese novels AWE is very enjoyable, even tho there's a repeated pattern, it won't bother the readers as much because every content, character, places, circumstances and Bai Xiaochun's disasters are new and still very funny.End of the review but i still have 50 more words to waste...... so via supreme dao of word count I'll just do a recap of what i meant by the repeated pattern on AWE.......PLOT TWIST! Changed my mind, according to the rule of Cliff hanger you now have to go and read the novel instead of the review to know what i meant.

I never laughed as much while reading than by reading this novel.Another masterpiece by Er Gen, and another proof of his comedy genius. But he knows how to make the atmosphere serious when needed.What I really love about this is that the abilities the MC learned at the start follows him through the entire novel. And really, the entirety of it. Furthermore, the MC has a kind of unfathomable charisma that makes people like him and love him, but still feast and rejoice when this monster finally leave them.Now read on, chicken stealing reader, you will not regret it!

Such a master piece both from the author or from Deathblade !I will not say much as i don't think i need to introduce muchWorld building : it's part of the same universe as renegade immortal and ISSTH so here you will find a comprehensive way to increase your strength and a beautiful worldCharacter : the main character is just perfectly hilarious. He has a good developpement on some key point while remaining the same at the core. and the side cast is also full of color without too much clicheStory  : A very well written piece. A good progression and some amazing twist. All of this couple with an overwhelming humor, i found myself laughing by myself at work (oups :p)I highly recommend this story

If you came for a serious novel, this isn't it. AWE is an awesome novel full of comedy and friendship. The main character starts out afraid of death but as the story goes on he become much more confident, though just as silly when out of combat. Most of the comedy comes from the MC's failed pill refining and utter shamelessness but the supporting characters are pretty good.My biggest complaint is that the novel feels extremely rushed near the end, though not as badly as some novels *coughspiritrealmcough*. It doesn't have many references to previous works and I'm unsure how the ending fits in with them.

A generally great cultivation novel with plenty of creative comedic moments, but remains grounded enough to take seriously. (It's not an anything-goes-and-nothing-matters comedy) There's a lot of unique creativity which is rarely or never seen in other cultivation novels. However, towards the end, it becomes repetitive in an unoriginal way, and the plot basically devolves into a power level inflation fest. Overall, a recommended read.(This is to make the 100 word minimum: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.)

This book has an excellent story. Most complaints are about the MC's character's traits. That complaint, however, is purely subjective.  This is a story about Will (of course) and preservation. The strength to maintain your values from start to finish. If you read this novel you'll notice that no matter how much the MC changes his main values remain intact. Although this novel is a Xianxia, most of its Xianxia elements are slightly diluted by the lighthearted atmosphere that the novel has. But this is what differentiates this novel from others. The bottom line is that this novel will not disappoint you (I hope) so read it.

This novel is great. This one of the few novels I have actually completed and stands up there. I think the story is great and they are plenty of moments that can hype up the story, which is the main way for me to get interested. But the best part is probably the character of Bai Xiaochun, who is extremely relatable and if you are bored of the classic hero personality then this is perfect for you. I think another great part of the novel is the story of him going from basically rag to riches. It’s a great Er Gen novel and can last you a long time.

like damn its a great phuckin novelwhat do u want Comedy? Action? Story?it lack those wuxia troopes some of us hate the most and it like the perfect paced not to fast not to slowthe MC feels real not just a set of dialogues and has a haremu wont get irritated by and senseless idiotic plot armourBia xiaochun has his own ARMOURthe villan is great the ending is great just overall a solid novelthis was my first ergen novel and man that dude left me satisfied its like among Er-gens best worksjust read 90 chapters first then decide

AWE is a must read. Bai Xiaochun's exploits are humorous, and made me laugh quite a few times. Although it's overdone sometimes, Er Gen sometimes balances it out with more serious elements, allowing us to see his serious side. It's different enough from most cultivation novels to make it worth your time. I would suggest reading it early on, especially as one of your first books here.Like I said, though the humor is dragged on a little too much, and sometimes you can't help but wish Bai Xiaochun were more serious. And sometimes the plot grows stale. But the bright spots in the novel make it worth it all.

If you haven't read it yet, you just don't know what you are losing.A Will eternal is mostly comedic and tries to make you laugh, unlike I shall seal the heaven that has some drama involved here it's mostly humor, I really love the ending, for those that don't understand it, go read I shall seal the Heavens, before or afterwards, it makes no difference.I won't ruin the plot for you, I will just recommend other Er Gen novels to you.My personal Favorite is XIan NI or Renegade immortal, which was how I found this site in the first place long ago, if you want to read about a serious cultivator protagonist, then you will love it.I shall Seal the heaven however is probably one of my favorites when it comes to emotions, It will make you laugh, thrilled and if you don't cry at a very specific point while reading it, then I'm sorry, because this is the most emotionally invested Chinese  novel I have ever read.Last but not least a few words for this novel, it was enjoyable, it was funny, the end.Haven't read Beseech the Devil and Against Heavens yet.

c'est un de mes top novel . i love it to o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o oo o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o oo o o o o o o o o o o o o o oo o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o ooo o o oooo o o o o o o o o o o o o ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much

The story has a good start. The first 60 chapters include a good fight scene and decent characters, and then it falls off... HARD.The MC is a pathetic, cowardly, boastful, moronic asshat 90% of the time, and then sometimes the author will change his character up to be witty or smart for 5 lines and then he goes back to being a sniveling loser. Every encounter the MC has is by complete chance, and the only thing he has actually earned is the first level of Undying Skin, which makes the user endure horrible pain. Everything else is pure luck. It gets even worse at the later chapters, with the MC completely skimping out on cultivating to do literally nothing, despite how scared of death he used to be and how driven he was to be immortal. It's like he doesn't care anymore. The only notable thing about the MC is that he cares about his friends enough to stop being a douchelizard for a chapter or two if they're in danger.There is no real comedy. All of the "comedy" centers around the MC being a boastful douche to everyone in his vicinity, or when the MC doesn't know when to shut him mouth, and it only stops once everyone around him is annoyed and starts to ignore him, or he successfully escapes them once their attack him. I'm genuinely scared for people praising how funny this story is, and how old they are, because I can't imagine anybody past 16 thinking any of the comedy is anything but obnoxious.There is no character development. I'm never even quite sure how old the MC is at any point in the story because of how his 8 year old mindset literally never changes. He acts boastful and annoying in every situation and it stays that way through the ENTIRE novel. No development whatsoever. Any side character development is either them falling head over heels for the MC, or absolutely loathing him.

I have translated a fantasy novel, I'm really interested in it, I even wrote a paper about this novel, which was yet to come. Now I am going to write another paper about the reader's absorption of the fantasy novel. I think I must lose myself in the fantasy novel translation. While, every coin has two sides, I was preparing for the examination. I hope I can finish the paper soon,  so I can move to the next. I think the fantasy novel does have its own value, for it appeals to so much fans. Really amazed to see so many followers.

I spend most of my time on this book it's very very good. following through from the bottom of the cultivation world n getting to the top and the comedy is really high class nothing better than a daily laugh after a hard day's job. Really cracks you up. The world of cultivation is big n very interesting by the way if one has taste for action n cultivation books then I recommend this one 'A WILL ETERNAL' N how the main character treats his life as treasure and is afraid of death so he can climb all the way to the path of immortality it's a mind blower.

A bajillion times yes. I think I was just in a daze for a couple hours after finishing this goddamn novel. The translation is sublime and the story even more so. Side characters and plot points come back five hundred chapters later and rarely does anything fade into irrelevancy.The MC, Bai Xiaochun, does get one cheat item in the very beginning of the story, but aside from that, it's the results of his own hardwork and boldness that carry him through the novel.A genre-bending, trope-twisting ride with my favourite protagonist of all time. Absolutely recommend it, along with all the other works Er Gen's written (especially I Shall Seal the Heavens and Renegade Immortal).Happy reading!

AWE is one of my favorite novels that I've read on WW. Er Gen has another masterpiece here, with an MC who is genuinely entertaining through and through. I would say that it takes a little bit to hit its stride, but I was hooked within the first 100 chapters.I think it hits a good balance that some of the other Er Gen novels didn't quite get to; the comedy is more consistent than in the other novels, and the story more engaging. You genuinely feel a connection with the characters for all ~1300 chapters.I highly recommend anything by Er Gen, or translated by deathblade, and this one is both :)*spoilers*The one downside is that I think the endings of RI or ISSTH were a bit better, but I do always enjoy seeing how the books are all shown to exist in the same universe and you can imagine how they'll be interacting with each other in the future.

This novel is both a tragedy and a comedy.The MC is a coward, but the good kind of coward. He does not like fighting and prefers running away, but he will never back down if the people he cares about are in danger. He is op, but believes himself to be weak. And he is a genius at creating weird pills. This gives rise to plenty of hilarious situations.The overall plot is not repetitive, which is rare in novels of this length. Side characters are not forgotten and the MC actually relies on their help. World building is very detailed and coherent.Final plus, the MC actually uses his brain.I really recommend reading this novel. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and in the end it will leave you satisfied.

My favorite Er Gen novel, and that's saying a lot as I was first sucked into the genre by I Shall Seal the Heavens. It's relatively fast-paced for a Chinese novel and is very funny. It's harem, but not unbearably so, mostly just in a funny way ;). Side characters, while not usually well-fleshed out are unique and entertaining. As usual, Er Gen is the king of intricate plotting (minor plot holes). If you like xianxia or xianhuan you'll like this! Oh...100 words. Umm...it also reminds me of heavenly jewel change or other novels with a fairly juvenile MC who still miraculously is popular with the girls. However, this MC is a little less annoying, mostly because he annoys everyone without prejudice. :D

Superb! You should read it! Ii is funny, sad, romantic, shameless, a lil dirty, detail in every aspect, especially the science part. The problem is that you can't stop reading after you start it. What a poor me that planning on reading for an hour but spent three hours to read and sleep at 3 am in the morning. Love you Er Gen, thanks DB. AWE is on par with ISSTH and IR. Can't wait to read your other novels. Now I have finished this one I can sleep with no worries at all. I have reached a milestone. Lol

Thank you! I couldn't stop reading! This is the novel that made me buy a VIP subscription. A Will Eternal Makes me laugh and keeps me excited for the next development every chapter. Bai is so relatable to others on so many levels you can't help bit cheer him on and laugh at his mistakes and frustrations. Comical and serious, A Will Eternal takes great care in balancing the two so neither becomes overwhelming. The writer is an amazingly talented author (Er Gen?) and I will be looking for his other works as soon as I am done with this one.

Just finished reading and first things first, this novel is funny but not to the exaggerated level that people on here praise it as. Its a bit more comedic than your average wuxia novel but not really by a large stretch, nor does the comedy overwhelm the story like you would assume based off these reviews.Next Lets get to the MC, and is nice refreshment from a majority of Wuxia MCs that are arrogant, haughty, and ruthless for no reason. What I like about this MC is that he doesnt get stronger because he has cliche goal of being an overlord or the strongest, guy just wants to live forever lol. Which makes him very cautious and what many call cowardly but also has his bottom line which is of course his poor little life and also his friends lives where he will discard his cowardice and become a man with steel veins.Now les get to the World, world building in this noval is kinda vague and simple, a lot of the time places just pop up without much explanation. One tip for readers is dont try to map out things especially at the start, its only towards the end of the novel that you would even get the smallest of ideas of what is where.Getting to side characters and harem, i wont say much as its not too different from other novals but, what i will say is that they arent annoying in this one and also with the people he meets you dont just forget about them later where the author just abandons them.Overall id give this a 8.5/10

Great story, funniest chinese novel ive read to date, and an interesting character with a story that isnt generic and painful to read like many other chinese cultivation novels. A true breath of fresh air for this genre.One thing that plesantly suprised me was how hints to the overall plot/underlying plot were given from very early on in the novel, showing that actual planning of the plot did occur.Hopefully many other authors will take notice, and actually plan out their story and characters in a way that doesnt get stale and painful to read after 100+ chapters.8/10

I enjoyed this novel a ton. I read this directly after reading I Shall Seal The Heavens and it's hard to say which I like better.There's a lot of comedy and the MC grows in a way that makes sense while never forgetting the core of his personality.I overall really liked the more light-hearted tone that this book had versus ISSTH, whereas the scope and overarching plot of ISSTH was more enticing to me.Once again the side-characters aren't forgotten and are sometimes crucial to keeping the story progressing.The only thing I wish was done a little differently was the ending, just because I like things more straightforward; However, there's nothing wrong with the current ending and I enjoyed it a ton as well.Either way, this was an incredibly enjoyable read and I would recommend it to everyone.

One of the funniest novels I’ve read so far. It has been a long journey, even losing sleep just to read more chapters, to come to a satisfying end. The story line is well thought and the translation is incredible.It starts a bit slow for me, since I like fast paced OP MC, but during the early phase of the novel, the author builds up the characters and they are not forgotten until the end, unlike some of the stories where the characters are just passing by to be killed by the MC (arrogant young masters and stuff). The overall experience was great!

This book focuses heavily on the humor, so if you start reading it and dislike the humor, you might as well just drop it as you probably won't enjoy the book. Overall, it was pretty decent. Wouldn't say it's one of his best, but perfectly fine.The ending was really disappointing and annoying in my opinion. From ~50-15 chapters from the end, I spent the whole time ticked off while reading them. I'll try to avoid spoilers and just talk about the ending in very general terms, but just a heads up. I would argue there's a bit of a twist ending, but it doesn't feel clever or make sense when looking back knowing how it ends. It feels more like Er Gen had an ending in mind from the very beginning, realized everyone knew how it would end, and changed it at the last minute. He spent the whole book setting something up, it's something only he and his people can do, and then at the end there's no real payoff. He just completely drops it with this fake payoff, then brings in this deus ex machina that was mentioned a few times.Another thing that really annoyed me about the end is that throughout the story, Er Gen avoiding having too many standard fights. Sure, sometimes there would be your normal, cathartic, OP smack downs, but for the most part the MC used his skills in unconventional ways to win. And the MC's fight against the Big Bad was enjoyable. That part did payoff everything that had been built up to thus far. But Er Gen had the side characters fight the Big Bad first and it was the most by the numbers fight I've read. After already being really annoyed reading the previous 30 chapters, to see such a horrendous fight sequence just about destroyed any interest I had left in the ending and I had to force myself to keep reading.Like I said, I enjoyed the last 15 chapters or so and the majority of the book was pretty interesting with some novel elements included in it, just disappointing that the end was bungled so much, imo.

Has everything you could want, fun cultivation system, fairly OP main character, harems, comedy drama it's a great read finished within 2 weeks it's really tough to put down once you start. The book is paced very well and there doesn't seem to be much filler in the chapters. All in all loved it if you liked or enjoyed I shall seal the heavens then you'll really enjoy this. It's not the longest book IV read but it definitely is fun and the author makes a good job at expanding the current world and the polt is well built thoroughly satisfied.

Overall, it was a fairly funny and enjoyable fantasy story. I'm not quite as enamored with it as I was with I Shall Seal The Heavens, but to its credit, that's a very hard act to follow. Overall, it's well-written, well-translated, and even though your milage may vary on Bai Xiaochun, his ability to get in and out of danger is pretty funny. I do think that the very end gets a little bit strange in terms of scale and concept, but that's not truly a deterrent. Worth a read if you enjoyed ISSTH, and it's a good addition to the Er Gen cinematic Universe.

I strongly recommend this book. The author is basically a genius of literature. The way he weaves comedy, action, characters personalities, world building, and other elements of the story is amazing.  The world building is especially well done in this book, and I honestly prefer it to ISSTH. The only thing I feel like this author cannot do perfectly is the romance aspect of the novel, the romance feels a little bit lackluster specifically regarding how strong the relationship to the main character is. Power levels are really difficult to get right but the author did wellAlthough the catchphrases of the main character are definitely 10/10. "I'm finished. Kaput"

Bxc you have made my day.. from your antics to your perseverance.. it has made my depressed life less depressing than it should have been and has kept me from going to the dark side and keep on fighting for life..Maraming salamat talaga sa mga translators ng novel na to and looking forward to more novels to read from Patriarch DeathbladeMore power! I also love how the story was not rushed and was built properly..I just wish there could have been more for BXC getting revenge on the little turtle for his mischieviousness heheheLove the novel!!!!

Reading only because I used a credit. Honestly the MC has brain rot. He never learns, is always a coward, is truly a narcissistic MC. Everything is for him and others are of little consequence. I'm being a bit harsh, but there is no way a person without brain rot make the same decision over and over.It actually gets aggravating that, he has the mind of a five year old. I so wish I didn't use a credit to read this. Hoping the MC would mature at some point, but now my hopes are gone at ch 400. Big SAD

A hilarious novel to say the least, Er Gen has outdone himself with this one.Lord Bai is an interesting character indeed, his motivations are rarely seen in most xianxia/xuanhuan MCs (which MCs are shown as being motivated by their fear of dying?), and his apparently cowardly, narcissistic and downright shameless aspects makes him seem like an irritating character at first glance.However his obsession for perfection in his plans and endeavors, his meticulousness to the point of being overly so in all the things he does, his motivation that makes him work like a madman under pressure, and finally, his selflessness and lack of hesitation to place his own life and safety on the line for the sake of others despite his fear of death, makes him a lovable character overall.The humor is the true highlight of the story. Lord Bai's schemes and tricks and shamelessness would often leave one rolling in laughter, and that's even the case when things go wrong for him. This is especially so when he does "research" and tries to refine pills. When "Plaugedevil" Bai refines pills, even demons will cry and beg for mercy (literally).However unlike other comedy novels where the plot and even the characters themselves get twisted or thrown aside by the excessive focus on humor, AWE has a great story, excellent world building, fairly great character development, moments that read straight out of a horror novel, and moments of feels, like real feels, enough to make one cry. It is a very balanced story and that's what makes it great in the end.One of my favourite novels and highly recommended for anyone who wants to read about an MC that is not a brutal and merciless slaughterer (Lord Bai can still dish out his own brand of brutality and mercillessness agains "bullies" though!).

After reading the other news as Martial World, Martial God Asura or the most popular based on pure action and fight, Kill, kill, kill, kill, you are courting death ... This story is fresh and i ve crazy giggles, an eternal laughting!The main character is nothing like a hero, a real poser like GU RAN (Nine Star Hegemon Body Art) which is a character that I love very much.A lot of animalistic eroticism, i m joking, poor beasts or rather happy beasts !!!this novel is short with a little over 1000 chapters, which is very reasonable. I can't take anymore of the more 4000 ch of MGA.Enjoy.Thank you !!!!!!

This is a cultivation novel with formidable mix of lightheartedness and humor.The antics of the protagonist and his fresh perspective balances the bloody and ruthless world of cultivation. Just this characteristic alone makes you want to root for the protagonist and support his unruly methods.I truly enjoyed the adventure and unraveling of mysterious of the Will Eternal universe. I think what the author tried with his character showed a good sense of humor and his ability to produce diverse set of characters.Specially liked the non-plot relevant links to ISSTH. It is feels like a sequel or prequel but not at the same time.

I'll try to keep this as descriptive as possible, without revealing any (major) spoilers. It starts, contrary to expectations, with a very 'innocent' and 'pure' guy called Bai Xiaochun. He's not really obsessed with cultivation to get stronger, nor is he on the road to revenge for some terrible incident that happened to him - He just wants to live forever worry-free with lots of money and women! But things never really work out the way he expects them to and he is forced to use his rather 'unconventional' methods to solve them.This novel is amazing and quite unlike the others in the universe of Er Gen. It's light-hearted and loves to go against usual Xianxia tropes. But, the thing I like the best was the way how all the things came together and linked with the pre-established plotlines in the other novels (its pretty mind blowing to see it all come together!) It does get a little draggy towards the end, but I assure you that nothing written is unnecessary. I implore you to give it a try and read till the end, and sincerely hope that you find the same joy and satisfaction that I did. THANKS!NOTE: You don't NEED to compulsorily read the other novels, but I would advise you to, since the others are awesome in their own right!

There is some slight spoiler about AWE and ISSTHA Will Eternal, a story about Bai Xiaochun who will eternally make good impression (laugh) all across the story. To me the comedy in this story is better than ISSTH except for the Lord Fifth and Lord Third ofcourse, compared to them Lord Turtle is lacking much. The thrill and comedy is always making me hook till the end, unlike past the certain part in ISSTH which the comedy become nonexistent, which is somewhat dissapointing after Lord Fifth and Third got me hook on the comedy, the comedy in AWE last till the epilogue so enjoy the comedy rollercoaster. Also another big plus is unlike in ISSTH you don't get the boring start in AWE so no enduring till chapter blablabla to enjoy the novel.If you like good comedy, action, and don't enjoy stupid power fantasy harem then rejoice harem is not the only thing matter in this novel unlike certain neighboring novel and the dickhead mche, then AWE is overwhelmingly recommended!P.S. AWE is way better than ISSTH :p

A Will Eternal is a great novel.Although i would prefer a different ending, it should have endend when the recreated eternal realm was under his control. Well i guess that would be impossible, the novel was shaped like that.7 / 10&amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp;

Kaliteli,komik,eğlenceli olmasının yanında;sürükleyici ve şaşırtıcı!! Kahraman sürekli şanslı ama  fazla korkak olmasının dışında sıkıntısı yok bence.Genel olarak da güzel bir roman.Bunun dışında okurken sıkmayan  türden aşırı şiddet ile tavsiye ederim.Çevirmene de teşekkür ederim.Ve tabii kitabın yazarı olanEr Gen  de teşekkürler.Bu kitabı okurken 1 yıl geçti şaka maka derken zaman fazla hızlı geçiyor gerçekten wuxiaworld ekibini kutlarım gerek bu seri gerek against the gods serisi kesinlikle çok severek okuduğum okurken eğlendiğim ama fazla şanslı olduklarını düşündüğüm seriler keşke bende bu kadar şanslı olsaydım diye düşündüğüm de olmuyor değil gerçekten işinizi layığıyla yapıyorsunuz hepinize tekrardan teşekkür ederim elinize emeğinize kolunuza sağlık yani daha ne diyeceğimi  bilmiyorum

I remember tuning in to wuxiaworld's website waiting for this to release every day, i kept refreshing the page to see if they updated with new chapters.This is a great novel. Just start and you wont be able to stop.The plot is amazing. Character is really funny. The cultivation path is consistent. What is known as strong at the start stays strong, not new levels being added every 20 chapters. All in all, i made an account to drop a review(and get some karma because this site changed so much haha). What are you waiting for, click on start reading

Super hilarious like none other! Er Gen is a master of Comedy like the other works he had done! MC is super quirky and contains many fasets and layers that compose his nature, leading to unexpected  and diverse action and behavior taken throughout the  events and story progression. 100 Super hilarious like none other! Er Gen is a master of Comedy like the other works he had done! MC is super quirky and contains many fasets and layers that compose his nature, leading to unexpected  and diverse action and behavior taken throughout the  events and story progression. DEFINITELY a Must Read!

Amazing novel that got me into XianXia as a whole, and Er Gen in particular. And I have no regrets.You can see that author really has experience. The world is extremely clear-cut and fleshed out, yet still deep and mysterious. Er Gen strikes right balance in worldbuilding and for once cultivation levels aren't all over the place.Characters are good, well-written and complex. Particular shout-out to examining how the harem will actually look like in the real life. That is probably one of the reasons I hold this novel above most of others on this site.Plot-progression is nice, neither fast nor slow, it is... just right. In fact, every aspect of this novel can be described as "just right". There is a good amount of plot-twists and the plot itself if kept fresh and interesting.Now if there is one problem I have with AWE is it's humor. It's not bad per se, but Er Gen can't really write a smart comedy. In previous novels, this kind of humor was on the fringes of the plot, it was very much measured and limited, but with time he included it more and more. Probably giving into demands of fandom, who have hard time recognizing that this humor worked exactly because there wasn't a lot of it. Oh well. At least it's not AWWP, so that is a silver lining.Over all, I wholeheartedly recommend AWE to anyone who can look past the peculiarities of novel's comedy. And if you like it, hell, even if you didn't, give a shot to other novels by Er Gen. RI and ISSTH in particular because they can be found on this site.

This novel probably had me laughing more than what 90% of standup comedians would manage to get out of me.Losing his parents at a young age, the MC Bai Xiaochun is afraid of death and pain and is a straight up chicken, something which shouldn't be funny but definately is. In his quest for immortality he learns alchemy, much to the horror of anyone and everyone around him (and himself) as his pills often have... unintended effects.As is usual with Er Gen, events and characters have a tendency to have an impact or make a reappearance a great deal further down the line.In a nutshell, the story is highly entertaining, the characters and world matter, and the translation courtesy of Deathblade is great. Read it, it won't disappoint!

Good.. nice to read. Every episode or chapter are very nice to read. No lecherouus scheme no such a big harem. I love to read those lucky time he encountered but sometimes make him the character to out to his turtle shell. I like emphasize the turtle more. I  like this novel other than those other novel that to much complicated make even those one problem getting into ten pieces.. too much complicated. I wish I can read more of the pages which don`t need karma. I am happy to read everyday. Thank you author and those who translated it.

Amazing novel. Both funny and entertaining.Somehow alchemy contained novels are my favourite.Looking forward for more such novels.I kinda read it non stop. Worth reading "A Will Eternal".MC is awesome, all characters including enemies and power up as well. location and imagination of different power are all awesome.Recommend to all wuxiaworld fans and readers. Worth spending time reading this "A Will Eternal"Thank you wuxiaworld for the work and effort on this.Thank you wuxiaworld for the work and effort on this.Thank you wuxiaworld for the work and effort on this.Thank you wuxiaworld for the work and effort on this.

One of the funniest novels that I have ever read.The novel is filled with witty jokes and schemes the main characters personality is the best. His character has no flaws he is constant in his act.The novel was a joy ride from the first page to the last, though it gets a little intense towards the end that gives the novel a different kind of flavour.I would highly recommend you to invest some time to read this if you are considering a novel that will bring a smile to your face, relatively less bloody and gore.A wonderful read.

Really worth reading with an amazing story writing and endless comedy....but.........I am reading quit at slow pace and even planing to drop because there the hero pace of growth is really slow and am not actually looking for a book to read with utmost attention and thought am just looking for an action novel to enjoy without pushing aside other thing.........good but too slow.,......an another advantage the book is really refreshing..... especially the comedy b b b b b b b hnh h h hnh hnh hnhnb b b b b b b b b b n by.

Er gen's books have really high highs and really low lows. This one is the most even keel/ balanced of all his works and hence my favorite. Highs are not as high but lows are not that low either.This is also one of the rare ones where the hero does not just fight or concoct away all his problems there is a really nice in the mid/later half of the series where hero makes political plays and that's real refreshing. The ending is a bit disappointing but I have read all Er gen's works and all of them have literally the same ending.

Rating: 10/10Bai Xiaochun is a living legend. Don't believe it? Then just ask him. Men want to be him. Women want him--he even carries around the love letters to prove it.And with the snap of his fingers, he can turn anyone to ash--a fact that scares even him.I read ISSTH and part of Xian Ni before this, so I was expecting AWE to be darker. Instead, Er Gen decided to do an action comedy. Before reading AWE it didn't occur to me that a sit-com xianxia could exist, because they are normally dark and revenge-driven. But it does work, and it's because Bai Xiaochun isn't just a one man army, he is a one man circus. You have to keep going, to see what ridiculous stunt he is going to pull next.I honestly get the feeling that Er Gen had too much fun writing the comedy bits in ISSTH and that he decided to combine Meng Hao, Lord 3rd, and Lord 5th into a single character. The result being a shameless pill maker, with an unparalleled talent for shenanigans.I enjoy well written (and well translated) xianxia. I also watch a lot of sit-coms like: The Office, Parks and Rec, Friends, 70s Show, etc. AWE is sort of a blend of the two, so Bai Xiaochun is my all time favorite cultivator.

9/10.- Funny (depends on your sense of humor. I found it very funny)- World is well-developed. Typical Xianxia but very diverse and complex.- It ends in a Harem. Can't say more cause I will be spoiling too much. But don't worry too much about it.- The MC is an absolute unit.- MC has very unique powers and abilities. Definitely one of the things I liked the most.- Memorable Side characters. Most of the humor lies in the interaction (and misunderstanding lol) between MC and the other characters. Especially the women.-Very well translated and good grammar.-Doesnt drag the story for too long. There is a good ending.Final words- A masterpiece. The standard to which I judge other Chinese Xianxia and Wuxia novels.(The only reason why I deducted a point is because of a certain waifu which I liked very much. I can't say more without spoiling but let me just mention that something about her plot-line was done off-screen and I wanted more. It's a very trivial reason and it may as well be 10/10 if you don't care for that girl at all.)

The most enjoyable and funniest wuxia i've ever read. Hard no to smile or laugh. Good job for both he author and translator, especially the translator which perfectly capture the "innocent" side of the main character and it he remarkable choice of word which takes us - the reader - to be involved in the plot. Just finish read the first 100 chapter and can't wait the explore further. Hope to find more funny things, more hilarious accidental achievement and yet also some serious plot. Hope to find the ending not so so just like other novels I've read. Hope to be surprised until the end

Dear lord, when i found it was like the good ol' heavens, and much of it after dropping for second time ISSTH. A good escape.Then there was humour non-stop, to the point where it was interfering with the actualy authenticity of the novel itself :^). Power levels get bad (as all of Er Gen's novels, eek), contradictions non-stop aren't something he even cares for to remove as a bad habit which persists even in 'A world worht protecting', so it's still disappointment and sadness, oh oh.HAREM, and well, for Er Gen's first harem, was done well. Very, very well- for a first. pd: (end was beautiful, those tears on Boo where nothing but an assurance that they finally -FUCKED LIKE ANIMALS IN CAGE WITHOUT RESTRAINT, and- got together.Ehem, so final battle, as in ISSTH, is much of an OUT-OF-NOWHERE crazy shit stuff never to be cleared up, means= much fun, yay.Well, it was times times times so much be- times-tter that ISSTh, phew. By far.

Bai Xiaochun is quite unique compare to various main characters/Hero and different from i've read before.  His antics is quite humorous and very down to earth. All i can say this novel is the funniest and enjoyable to read.  Can't wait to read the next chapter and see how will his character develop.What i don't understand now is what merit his parents has to make Elder Li owns them. Another thing is why his fear of death when learning martial arts to strengthen himself.Er Gen is a great writer and a big fan of I shall seal the heavens. Good work.

This is the best... might not be your average 'martial path' dao cultivation novel but rather a eternal life one... i mean cultivation is for eternal life....anyways the mc is amazing i love how er gen can stabilize the mc's development and characteristic...its completely amazing dont forget the comedy and also the fact its not always happy-go-merry. seriously just try it Alchemy in AWE is amazing as a novice-novel reader i am absolutely positive that this is one of the best novel's no doubt.Well the story is one thing i also like the fact that this is so nicely translated props to Deathblade im gonna probably try ISSTH next peace

COMEDY+CULTIVATION+TRAGEDY+AWESOME WORLD-BUILDING+SHINING ARCH ENEMIES+ A POSER MC==== A WILL ETERNAL.TLDR- TOTALLY WORTH YOUR TIME. :) (@-@)I have enjoyed this novel a lot, so much that it is one of the few novels for which i took the initiative to go and read the Machine Translation of the original work.Guys, this novel is a legend at Wuxiaworld.com.CHARACTER- The character, each of them, from the MC to the villains, have a role to play and not a superficial one but something that adds into the story.You must have heard that famous writers say that if something does not contribute to your novel when writing a about a character or similarly for any other plot device, remove it. But here, each dot is connected and something which happend in the past may come back to haunt your present.STORY- As i have completed the novel as it was going on, i can fully assure you, my dear reader, that the story is lucid and smooth, and it has tragedy and political intrigue in it, the tag is not for decoration and attention-seeking.The MC has path full of thorns which he crosses leaving behind roses of blood into the ground which blooms into the night sky.WORLD-BUILDING--- In the starting of this novel, you may feel a bit off(very tiny bit, as the sect in itself something very different from another typical cultivation sect) but I assure you that the world here, is actually massive and contributes hugely to the progression of character and the story.I assure you that it is worth your time.

❤❤❤💯💯💯So few realms compared to RI ...  haven't read it though , only till 400+ chapters , kinda got me bored ,definitely not for me , and the fact that Er Gen made RI and PoTT that good still doesn't make me wanna read the next two novels that seem like are made for normies , but yeah , this truly shows the evolution of cultivation world , compared to the ancient times from RI and PoTT where cultivation was very hard , it seems a lot easier in AWE and ISSTH , they even have fewer realms , especially the new novel made by Er Gen , haven't read it , but i will probably do , i mean i kinda like those modern novels with cultivation , except those that happen on Earth , where i have to deal with all that racism against Japanese and that China is omnipotent and all that shit ... yeah but some people should realize already that with all these novels , it clearly shows the evolution of the multiverse created by Er Gen , so it's "EVOLUTION" so some people really need to stop thinking BXC or MH are stronger than WL or SM ... they live in a time a lot more developed than the one WL and SM lived in , and the cultivators got more civilized , i mean in the new novel from i have understood , they even have school for cultivator and federation ... so it's a lot more civilized , i doubt the mc will have to deal with every master he gets , New master=New enemy , or that's how it was for WL ... they all wanted to kill him ... except a few

Aside from the final book, the series is good, especially the first 100 or so chapters.While the story is repetitive/contrived in how conflicts are created and resolved from arc to arc, a few characters seem to be forgotten about by the author, and the numbers given for sizes/distances make little sense, most of the story before the final book is done well, and there were entire chapters where I couldn't stop laughing. The harem elements are kept light and, for the most part, don't progress too quickly or detract from the story until very late, which is nice, as harem developments very often detract from stories like this.Then the final book happens... The "main" girl (who's been a repeated plot point from very early in the novel all the way up to the end of the book 6, where there's major development in the relationship between her and the MC, where both clearly wanted a committed relationship), is abandoned in the most unsatisfying way that I've ever read, and after a certain point, it doesn't even make sense, because how powerful the MC is stops being consistent with the reason given. The harem he does end up having is, IMO, a bad one, and he never seemed to want a committed romantic relationship with any of the girls in it (although I'm generally not a fan of harem developments, as they tend to be written in a way that feels too forced, and detracts from other parts of the story, so...). The passage of time relative to events becomes inconsistent. Other characters do things that make no sense or are outright impossible even in context of the setting.There is a core of the story in the 7th book that's okay, but too many of the side points/plots and relationships were more than just disappointing, and felt like a slap in the face after everything that happened earlier in the story. Ending things as a tragedy at the end of the 6th book (with some minor adjustments so that would make sense) would have been more satisfying. I wouldn't have particularly liked that, but it wouldn't have angered me like book 7 ended up doing.I'd give the first 6 books a ~7/10 or so overall, and the final book a ~4/10.

Another epic novel from ergenMany people are complaining that the mc is too scared to do anything dangerous and is a wimp and all but trust me BX is a more realistic character than many other, no one would want to be a daredevil seeking death everywhere and it is also the opposite of our mc's goal.And the comedy which people say is too bland and repeated you will be laughing everytime you read itThe world building is great and it's connection to the overall story in ergen universe will probably be known in a world worth protecting so read ergen all novels before reading a world worth protecting cuz there will a lot of connectionDrawn from the rest of the books there

Read It.This is a Goddamn Masterpiece.Though at times you may feel it is getting repetitive or boring there is always that light hearted element keeping you interested.LOVED IT. . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . .. . . . . .Finally Word Count Reached , Phew .

nice....good reading...the protagonist is so mischievous and prone to a lot of antics without meaning too....so far i am enjoying reading this novel. His fear of death has spurred him to cultivate more and his pursue of eternal life makes him formidable in the world of cultivation. Compared to some of the novels i have already read, this novel's protagonist is somewhat refreshing and it makes you want to know more with every page you read. This protagonist is so full of life and character with a sense of humor as compares to some protagonists from other novels which is too straight forward and sometimes boring.

Amazing! One of the only novels to have ever hooked me on to read till the end. Most novels I will just read for the first 300-500 chapters and then end up dropping because it gets too boring. This book was absolutely perfect, made me laugh, angry, sad, all the emotions. Contrary to many other novels out there the novel is continuously funny. It might not be for everyone to stick around till the end, but even if you read for a couple hundred you will enjoy the ride, trust me on that. There’s also some sad moments in there, I can’t get over Sect neice Zhingxi author did her dirty 😭😭😭

One of the best noble out there! Truly diff from others! while it has fighting &amp; tragedy moments like other cultivation type noble, the comedy is definitely its biggest plus point. U will die laughing. even in the deadliest of moments the mc somehow makes it full of comedy. a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a Definitely worth reading

This is awesome novel.... A will Eternal is a highly recommend novel.. its funny to read and sometimes it get serious again.. its not boring unlike other novel...by reading this in the morning and before bedtime it bring me in a different world a world of fantasy that make you wonder and imagine things. He has multiple personality that make this novel interesting. And also this novel is different from other's specially the main character is so much afraid of death totally worth it of your time from mortal to immortal . hahahah read read read read read read and enjoy

First, kudos to the translator and the author.This is definitely a keeper!  It's hilarious and will keep you wanting to read more.  You will either grin, laugh-out-loud or giggle while reading it (portions of it).Other reviewers already said most of the synopsis so I won't bother. I'll say my thoughts on the story overall.The story pace so far (up to chpt 100 right now) is spot on - not too slow or too fast.  So far I haven't seen any or alot of parts that describes the characters' features on and on and on (eyes-rolling) again and again like other stories I've read which is absolutely refreshing.So read it, you (probably) won't regret it.

I really liked this novel, the story, the world, the cultivation, the battles, everything is great besides the MC. I have such a love-hate relationship with this novel because of the MC. Hes a coward, hes too afraid for his "poor little life". Even after becoming a powerful expert this trait just wont go away.Dont get me wrong, hes heroic by nature and a total badass when he takes action. Its just the fact that every other time he goes back to being a coward for no reason at all. I feel it was mostly a creative desition for comedys sake but theres a point when he has proven himself and others that he is a powerful expert and a hero and he still goes back to being afraid of his poor little life. God, I hated that phrase and its repeated again and again and again.I do recommend reading it. its really well made and it definitely wont feel like a cheap power fantasy. Just be aware that the major flaw of the MC will never go away.

It's 1:34am and I just finish this novel...Man the ending....MC is comedy just like a lot of the other reviewers mention. He's as funny as Long Chen and Gu Ran from NSHB.If you read ED, Martial World, ATG, NSHB, etc... and is looking for some great entertainment then this novel is the one for you. One of the best I've read and the ending boy oh boy. It left this big hole in the middle of my chest because of the things he had to go thru and the time it took him to get there was yea heart breaking.10/10 if you're reading this comment then you need to stop and start reading ch. 1

Bai Xiaochun is such a one helluva character. Awesome yet funny story line! Loved the protagonist and his entertaining attitude, easily one of the most, epic, hilarious and the greatest coward main character I have ever come across. I have LOL'd sooooooo many times while reading his antiques and shenanigans. This novel got a great plot and story pacing. A desire to live forever, a desire to protect! Even the fighting scenes are spectacularly funny and well written in such a heroic, gory and intense kind of way! Very entertaining indeed! It never gives a repetitive vibe storyline. Highly recommended!

this is a very nicely written novel i feel that i have been missing out on a whole different world because of this so it is really good to have started to read  this novel i want to big up the author and translator Er Gen and Deathblade this is one hell of a novel. Thank you. when i read the synopsis A Will Eternal is the fourth major xianxia novel by the renowned Er Gen. It tells the tale of Bai Xiaochun, an endearing but exasperating young man who is driven primarily by his fear of death and desire to live forever, but who deeply values friendship and family. The story takes place in the same Universe as Er Gen's other novels, but is a separate story and can be read alone. That said, it does have connections to the other novels, especially I Shall Seal the Heavens. Those connections only pertain to a handful of chapters, so you can read the novel as a whole and enjoy it without first reading ISSTH. However, the best reading experience would begin with the later portions of ISSTH. This novel is much more comedic and light-hearted than Er Gen's previous works, although it has its fair share of action and drama. i new it would be amazing.

Amazing story, very funny and it’s amazing to read. At first I was skeptical about the story but It dazed me with Bai Xiaochung extravaganzas. Recommended to read. It’s a must.The development of the carácter power was amusing to see that it changes through out its progress and th enemies that Bai faces Evelio es with time.I’m at the 130 chapter and can’t stop reading. I was hook the moment the fighting started. And I must say the that the novel is not all about fighting. You still get a good laugh every time the author can. Will eternal rules.

There is no doubt that er gen work with deathblade translation ends up in a really polished work. Even if for me it's really not the best I read from er gen it has the humour and light atmosphere added to the usually profundity, philosophy and poetry I was more used to. It is in the kind of "a world worth protecting" if you are reading it and liked it you'll definitely like this one.If you're new to the cultivation type novels I recommend this one as it's really well built, well written and well translated but it's more childish than other et gen works like "I shall seal the heaven", "renegade immortal" and "pursuit of the truth" that I really recommend.

this is a good novel with its own unique taste. there are some "junk food" type story in here, but at least its not a main dish. i like it because it is more logical than some other cultivation novel like this. logical means it is not like story where the main character just find some super ultra rare weapon or tool for boosting cultivation and then become "junk food" typical story. the most i like from this novel is the comedy in there, not because "junk food" typical comedy, but because the main character's unique personality.*junk food: a typical story where young master beat some random dog at street.

Very funny and entertaining book but sometimes there is bullshit reasoning behind some of the things he does which is irksome, also I think it could do without the harem aspect of it. That said if you like harems I think this one is done very well.Good world building and interesting cultivation style as well. I also like the characters personality a lot but I just got to say that his morals are completely stupid like most mcs.10o word 1oo word 100 words 100 words 10. Words 001 words 007 words 100 word 10l words qoowords 100 words

A good novel from Er gen. Of his four books, this is the closest to xuanhuan. The hero is righteous, although a bit cheeky.As I am not a fan of harems, I cannot say that I liked that aspect of the story but at least the two of the relationships were not too contrived. At least they had a good reason to like him and not just because of blatant hero worship as in most novels.The MC is hilarious and very cheeky. If you like Meng hao, you will like him.Also the novel's end fits in nicely with the previous stories.

This was my very first novel because it’s the first one I saw on the homepage like 5 years ago and I do not regret starting with it. Although not used to the different style of humor novels have at the time, Bai Xiaochun still had me laughing my ass off with his antics and way of dealing with things. I love the humor that can be found in this and A World Worth Protecting, both by Er Gen. Though not as humorous, I also like Er Gen’s I Shall Seal the Heavens. I totally recommend reading this, even if you are a seasoned reader.

Great Novel!The MC is diverse but consistent in his motivation. His pettiness and greed can sometimes be a little annoying. He usually redeems himself just often enough to be likeable.The universe is just interesting enough to keep you reading although it is much more about the MC and less about the world he inhabits at large.Translation is so well done, makes reading AWE comfortable to read. This makes it easy to gobble up the chapters when compared to other Translated novels that make you brain do extra work trying to decipher what is going on.Would definitely recommend

Great read, à little slow in the begining tho. Very different from all the other characters from the same author. I couldn't quite get attached to Jim but on the other hand all the other character were quite likeable. They're the main driving force of the hero. The comical aspect was a bit too much. I couldn't feel as much tension and despair from this hero like all the other and he was way too lucky. Plot armor too strong. For a wuxia the hero should be domineering. One come kills one, a million come kills a million. Cultivation is about fighting the heavens and man

Excellent. One of the best I've read. Kind of drags in the beginning and end but otherwise perfect. Only tip is to read I Shall Seal The Heavens first since it makes some aspects clearer. Definitely not a requirement though. The characters are consistent and humor is well placed throughout the story. This is the biggest pull of this novel. I was recommended this novel as a cultivation + romance type of story. This is false, there is little romance in the story. Its still a very entrancing read and I recommend giving it a try. Very well translated, thank you DB!

One of the favorite novels I have read on this site. It has comedy, badass MC, good world building as well as action with some genuine heartfelt and heart-wrenching moments peppered here and there.MC is in my top 10 MCs list and hands down the best poser/coward/funny type MC you can get anywhere. Although he starts cultivating for a flimsy reason and loves his life more than anything, his character is developed to eventually overcome these faults in his personality.As with Er Gen's other novels romance is never a central plot, but still it peeks here and there. Side characters also not that developed and remain monotonous but only relevant to the story whenever they appear.The novel is one of the best in representing the animal characters, {SPOILERALERT} especially those on which MC experimented on.It has the best companion beasts in a non-beast tamer MC novel in Bruiser and the little mischievous turtle. The ending is one of those open ended cliffhangers with a surprising semi-cameo from one of Er Gen's previous novels.Whatever people are saying about the ending, I felt it satisfying, unlike other novels where there is 1-2 epilogue chapters after the MC vs Biggest Baddie fight. This novel continues its story even after the final battle to give it a good heartfelt ending.

While I recommend this novel, it is undeniably a disappointing one considering it is written by the author of ISSTHThe good+ Unique MC+ Fresh humor at the beginning+ Strong writing style as per Er GenThe bad are- MC that never grows up other than learning he has to kill to survive-Bland side char and setting where everything revolves around MC and no one achive something great without MC help- Compared to ISSTH, plot is a lot, lot more unplanned- overuse of same-ish humor- Naive and overimpulsive MC that gets annoying when he never gets bad consequences of his actions- Pacing is a problem sometimesOveral, the MC is literally the strength and the downfall of this novel. It is a great read at the beginning due to its fresh humor but at the later part, the plot just gets stale and the juvenile MC gets more and more annoying. considerign that, it is not surprising that this novel is cut short and its ending rushed. Anyway, still a worthwhile read for a CN novel.

Masterpiece. I never laught as much in any other novel so far. Author is growing after each new novel and this is a proof.Altho this is one of tipical cultivation novels MC will not make you feel it. He is good guy whose fear of death will make you laught and leave you satisfied. His innocent fails that will be torture to everyone around him makes this novel one of a kind.The only thing that was not by my taste was the ending, but it didnt leave me unsatisfied.I can easily put this novel at the top of all others that I read so far

An amazing story with good comedy, a great protagonist that grows a lot through his journey, an excellent power system that is paced well, cool powers that’ll impress those who read, and some good fighting scenes to boot.I love this novel and can’t recommend it enough. I’ve read it three times now, and keep coming back to it. If you haven’t, I really recommend checking this out!Er Gen’s stories are always great and I can’t stop recommending such great works! I sincerely hope that anyone reading this will pick up A Will Eternal and read it themselves and joins Bai Xiaochun on his journey!

My best xianxia novel.This book's MC i.e Bia Xiaochun is unbelievably hilarious.The book is one of the funniest things I have ever read. Every time I re-read this book, I am always trapped inside a cycle of hysterical laughing until its half-past-3 in the morning, and I'm having too much fun to even imagine sleeping.The action is intense, the characters are very relatable, villains entertaining, and the main characterHe's too much of a legend to explain here, and I shan't spoil it for you. But prepare for laughs, and prepare to see real character growth from the beginning of the book to the end…

Like most readers, I really liked this very funny, entertaining and hilarious  novel. The MC character is very special, endearing ... and catastrophic! Even after growing to the final cultivation stage...The others characters are very appealing, the villains entertaining (except the last one) and the action is intense ... there are very few steady(*), boring or repetitive phases.(*) no calm phase: mainly due to the MC actionsThe initial world is pretty clearly laid out, and are quite originalI must really emphasize how entrancing this novel really is, perhaps one of the funniest novels.In short, I utterly recommend this novel

Super duper refreshing!A will eternal is keeps you very immersed in the story and you never get bored, although sometimes the mc seems like a coward and it annoys me.A poser mc is always refreshing to see and the world-building is phenomenal!He is extremely hilarious and makes you proud in his achievements.Rating: 80/100The ach-enemies are also well builtIt is just as duskMaiden saidI just love love love this novel!It is one of my favoritesAgainst the godsA will eternalDuke pendraginOvergearedISSTHCHAOTIC SWORD GODEr gens work is generally amazing! I really recommend it

done with AWE and ISSTH, two more to go! Thankfully I encountered this kind of novel I strongly recommend this book. The author is basically a genius of literature. The way he weaves comedy, action, characters personalities, world building, and other elements of the story is amazing. The world building is especially well done in this book, and I honestly prefer it to ISSTH. The only thing I feel like this author cannot do perfectly is the romance aspect of the novel, the romance feels a little bit lackluster specifically regarding how strong the relationship to the main character is

Huh, is very good novel.Unfortunately, its ending seems incomplete and makes you hungry for more additional events.The protagonist is a comedian and a lot of comic events happened to him by chance - such as how he acquired two wives and practiced his relationship with them under the influence of medicinal pills haha-.The hero's past is mysterious during childhood and the events in the end are unclear...Unfortunately 😓 he did not marry that poor girl.What else, I didn't say anything more than  that . Why I should be write 100 it's so much huh .

One of the best novels I've ever read, here! Bai Xiaochun is quite an interesting fella and his antics are refreshing as well. Poor litt... er, ahem... Bai Xiaochun journey starts a little slow but the pace gets good after he is forced to act, and he even frightens himself... good comedy, interesting cultivation system and a overall good story.  It has good world building, some really nice side characters, a bunch of interesting antagonists and some really epic battle moments. His pill dao/dao of medicine is a really likeable aspect of the story and a great comedy relief too. Highly recommended for those who like funny and mostly lighthearted stories.

A Will Eternal, truly makes you wish the book was eternalTLDR - a must readA Will Eternal is a must read, the writing is great the main character is down to earth and human and the side characters don't get deleted by the author in a few chapters and stick around, even taking the spot of the main character at a few points.However I must warn you that the ending and a few parts of the story will make you profoundly sad and slightly overwhelmed. But other than that I hope you enjoy reading A Will Eternal as much as I did.

Like many other novels this one eventually features a realm ascension and in my opinion the novel lost a lot of its appeal after that with its defining comedic traits almost entirely disappearing which led me to eventually drop it.Until then however it is a fantastic read with the author bringing out all of his strengths with cultivation and alchemy descriptions, drama, funny and serious fights, everything you like about Er Gen.The MC is an endearing coward that likes to boast and this mixture of a serious outlook on prioritizing his life and liking to be in the limelight - even if he may lack the qualifications - sets him up for many hilarious and at the same time very relatable situations that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

Sighing, he said, “Bai Xiaochun, I, Li Qinghou... have let down your Bai Clan.” In his bitterness, he flew off into the distance. He wasn’t willing to entrust the search for Bai Xiaochun to others. If there was even the slightest hope that he was alive, he himself would search for him.Li Qinghou left, flames rising high into the sky behind him. As for the Inner Sect disciples, expressions of excitement began to appear on their faces. Now more than ever, they realized how powerful and glorious their sect was.I wonder where Bai Xiaochun now ? Hmm .

If we are compare this novel to other Er Gen creation - this is different. And I want to say - this experiment and something new get successful. If you are looking to something new in fantasy then you shouldn't miss it. Especially first part of novel made me laugh lot. I am really like how main hero Bai Xiaochun try to survive in this dangerous world and how he can make from something simple to disaster:) And someone will find that personally of Bai Xiaochun not really bad or idiot, no I think he is may much better, then most from us. Any way I hearth advice you to spent you time on this hilarious and awesome story. it's one of master piece of Er Gen.

This is one of the funniest novels i have ever read. I'm not much in favour of harem type but here It does not have that much impact on the story and it's OK. Although the end of the series is a bit fast and maybe doesn't make much sense, this actually happens to a lot of novels. If you liked novels like ISSTH, for sure you should read this one. For sure It Will not dissapoint those of you that want to search for an easygoing and finished novel to read and have some laughs with the MC. Definitely recommended.

This brings back so many memories i can remember those times just by looking ath this novel, this made me laugh so much back then when i first read it, its a very interesting novel with comedy that keeps you reading more and more.If you are debating reading this trust me do it it is definitely worth your time world building is great and characters are often fleshed out not just arrogant young masters looking to get face slapped. The MC is not completely unserious and thats the good thing the mix of both comedy and actual plot is done very well. READ IT!

It is a great novel. I have read it three times already and I am about to read it once more.Its has it all:comedy - yesplenty of power ups - yesshowoff main character - yesharem - yesdrama - yesgreat enemies - yesbeautiful world building - yesgood story -yes.Everything I can say about it, it will not be enough.Also, we can not forget the great translator Deathblade (who also translated  the 'I shall seal the heavens' novel - which I think is it's prequel, but I am not 100% sure)

Interesting to say the least. Gig is a little more complicated than I thought u were sleeping in the afternoon and I don't know how to feel about it and I don't want to talk to me about it anymore but I know you are the best and I hope you are doing well and I hope you are having a great time in the afternoon and I hope you are having a great time in the afternoon and I hope you are having a great time in the afternoon and I hope you are having a great time in the

This is pretty similar to I shall seal the heavens but I feel like the main character is a bit less likeable. Also as an American reader it's weird the relationships they have with women in the sects. Like are the women equals in cultivation or are they they worse because they are physically weaker... It comes up a few times that women need to be afraid on their own because of men and their rape antics. Once again the author uses rape as like comedy which seemed less bad with lord fifth as it was just like birds but like there is straight bestiality with a dog spirit beast raping their cultivator master.Despite this it's a mostly fine cultivation novel.

One of the best cultivation novel offered by WW!!! It is an absolute delight to read about Bai Xiaochun and his crazy antics. The comedy element is pulled off so perfectly that it couldn't have been done better. Sure it's long and the ending is quite strange and abrupt, but it is Bai Xiaochun I'm here for.A Will Eternal is about how a boy who wants to live forever and is willing to do anything for it. He has no special background, it is purely skills and sheer luck that gets him so far. BX will make you look over him fondly and no matter how old he gets and how 'lofty' his cultivation gets, he will forever remain to be the cunning, yet stupidly crazy protagonist he is. BX is definitely one of the most unique MC, not your generic ones that are cool/aloof/amazing etc etc.I definitely recommend it, so everyone please be patient and sit for a long yet fun journey!!!!!PS: Have I mentioned that BX is a poser? And a perfectly believable one at that? And a genius too?

This is a solid novel, shorter than some of the others he wrote but filled with a lot more comedy. The journey is still filled with good life and death battles and the main character does not have an easy super power to get out every time. Much like ISSH it is a struggle; however, there is a lot more silliness with character relations and how the MC thinks. Also translated by one of the best and most trusted translators brings the best English experience. I started this years ago and i can still remember some of the goofy events that the MC rushes into.

my love for this series cannot be understated by far in my opinion the authors best work, read it a few years back then just watch the anime with re-ignited my interest in this series of books and now i just want to re-read the whole thing all over again.a great cast of characters that are hard to forget even after you've finished reading it. personal favorite is the main protagonist himself Bai Xiaochun who's antics always give me a smile.has some of the best action put to words on this site which don't feel oversaturated as there are moments of comedy and light-hearted fun in between.Overall a good read and must for any fans of the cultivation genre.

- Hilarious- Funny- Protagonist not too OP, every fight he win have a reason- Great world building system- If you are a fan of old work of ER GEN ( Very recommend ). There is many gimmick from old work (eg. I shall seal the heaven you will like.- How do I write more than 100 words with this? LOL- Every side character have a good characteristics.- Hilarious again. LOL this is the most good point of this work. You won't find any wuxia/xianxia novel this funny out there.- Thank you for reading :)

While "A Will Eternal" by Ergen is an enjoyable read, there were a few aspects of the novel that fell short for me. Firstly, some of the characters felt underdeveloped and one-dimensional, which made it difficult to become fully invested in their journeys. Additionally, the story does rely on some common tropes of the cultivation genre, which can make some plot points feel predictable.Another issue I had with the book was the pacing. While the overall pacing was well done, there were times when the story felt rushed, particularly towards the end. Some plot points and character arcs could have been given more time to develop, which would have made the ending feel more satisfying.Finally, while the humor in the book is well-done, it may not appeal to all readers. Some of the jokes and antics may come across as juvenile or crass, which could be a turn-off for some.Overall, "A Will Eternal" is a solid read, but it does have its flaws. While the world-building and main character are strong, some of the supporting characters fall short, and the story does rely on some common genre tropes. The pacing can also feel rushed at times, and the humor may not appeal to all readers. Despite these issues, however, the book is still an enjoyable read for fans of the genre, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and engaging adventure story.

Alright, this is the start of my 100 words review. So far so good, I’m not sure what to tell you about. There are so much I can say, but so little without spoiling the story. If you’ve read up to this point; then you might as well start reading the novel. I can promise you that there’ll be plenty of laughs. This is like my first ever cultivation/comedy novel, and I love it. I do have to say I was very sad how the story seems a little rushed near the end, but it was a pretty nice ending.Wow, that paragraph was exactly 100 words. Look at me, I might as well go for the broke . It may seems like a lot was done to describe how I achieve my 100 words, but it all happened within the amount of time a spark flies of a flint. If you know what I mean, you know. ;) only those who have read this novel will truly understand.In all seriousness, this novel is actually good. The protagonist has a very nice but almost no character development. He is blessed by karma, and will always come up on top; no matter what. Although, I guess a lot of cultivation novels are like that; the protagonist comes up on top.Read it! The best laughs I’ve gotten was when he…. ‘Kaput…’ I almost spoiled the novel. Taheeehehe.Highly recommended!!

I have enjoyed this novel a lot, so much that it is one of the few novels for which i took the initiative to go and read the Machine Translation of the original work.there is every bit of life and comedyIt has one of my favorite main characters to date. His fear of death and pain grounds him to reality and relatability. Sometimes there are too straight-laced or serious main characters that feel bland or boring. Well not this one, The main character Bai Xiaochen is bursting with his personality.hope for future it would still be interesting

So what if one day Meng Hao meets Bai Xiao Cun. Okay, the final Dao that will impress... Live forever and be rich. Oh even that is my dream and that of everyone in the world, anyone would want it, right? AWE was more entertaining than ISSTH which brought tears to my eyes... Hmmm who's chopping onions. More entertaining from the side of BXC's innocence and of course his greed for eternal life. Well in the end BXC was trapped in the net of his Dao colleagues. Ah, love is indeed suffering without end... Thanks to Deathblade for your hard work in translating this incredibly entertaining novel.

I enjoyed it at first, but the comedy got repetitive and a funny situation can only be funny so many times. Literally everywhere he went he would cause very similar situations to happen and people would have very similar reactions. There are some sober moments where the comedy takes a back seat, and these were the most enjoyable for me.Maybe it gets better later on, seems like a lot of people like it, but it wasn't for me. I jumped off somewhere around chapter 450. Maybe i'll give it another shot in the future when I run out of things to read. I don't have a negative opinion on this novel, my attitude is more of neutral indifference so i'll give it a thumbs up since there is no side ways thumb and the translation was of great quality.

In my opinion, it is the least readable xianxia creation of Er Gen so far.First of all, the whole stile was changed to become more like a comedy and much less like a "vengeance was riding across vengeance, sees V in V, puts V in V, V V V V V V V". Wich is not necessarily a bad thing, considering, it would give characters better motivation.Do we see improvements in motivation for side characters? Not really. For main characters? No.Comedy-like style also implemented less "deadly" situations, as they just keep circling around the same route: Deadly situation (2-3-5 chapters), fight (for wich MC is fully prepared [for whatever reasons]), jokes about how good he is (better than everyone else in his (and previous) generation (-s)), idle life with typical comedy situations (he concocts medicine/flame, he fails, smthing bad happens, but it's alright as victims are angry but harmless, cycle it).As a result, at least for me, it became increasingly harder to find motivation to read it.Dialogs and monologues on DAO? Screw it!Smooth character development? Nah!Reasonable challenge-award system? What a joke, he is MC in xianxia( ! ), is he not?And on more than 1 occasion there is no logic in overall actions of the World around MC. He seems to live in a dream, where he's every wish comes true.I am still reading it, and it's definitely not the worst thing to read, especially with Deathblade's translation and those Memes, which hit the spot in literally 99,99% of the chapters.But the whole novel looks like Er Gen tries to say, he is being held hostage...Hope he was rescued <3

One of the best chinese cultivation novel I've ever read, and my favorite amongst Er Gen's work. Bai Xiaochun is a lovable and at times very relatable protagonist.As part of the many that follow this novel while its translation was on going, I can honestly say that it's always a part of my day that I look forward to. And from the many comments you'll find under each chapter, you can also see that others greatly enjoy it as well.Well I've said what I wanted, but have yet to reach the word count. So all I can say now is "what're you waiting for? Go read it now!"

I, Al6, am a very kind-hearted person, so i shall write this review for you, in hopes that you might also read this.Comedy.Comedy, comedy, comedy.Hey, are you looking for a happy go lucky story, that makes you wanna slap your knee while laughing?Well, by reading this, with just a flick of my sleeve i reduced my boredom to dust.Storywise it's not the best of Er Gen's novels, all of the others in my opinion beat it in that department.does that mean the story is bad and there's no character development?Our MC Bai Xiaochun is smart and good-looking, although not as much as me, and out of all the characters in Er Gen's novels he's my favorite.He's here to show us that something "serious" such as cultivation can also be taked with another approach.Most MCs just want to protect the people they love ecc and that's fine, but this guy?Nope. he just wants to live forever, and he'll go to any lenghts to fulfill that wish.what's interesting is that in this novel, although i believe there wasn't as much character development in the whole of things, Bai Xiaochun specifically changes a lot during the story, and it's something you as a reader can certainly feel through the story.All in all, this reviews now finished. Kaput.

Funny ^^ I never bored when i read this novel.Progress all makes sense and granmaster Bai is awesome legendary ^^ Only my regret is its final little bit not satisfy me. Highly recommed.Read it . Jussst awesome dude.This novel in my top 3 .I dont like 100 words need so i will spam somethink xDRead it you will love ^^Read it you will love ^^Read it you will love ^^Read it you will love ^^Read it you will love ^^Read it you will love ^^Read it you will love ^^Read it you will love ^^Read it you will love ^^

Best storyline so far, mesmerizing protagonist character. If it has to be 100 word, damn it's too long. I mean good story doesn't have to described in 100 word. As long few remarkable and wonderful word were able to describe the good story, then why it have to stuck at 100 wird minimum. Simplicity is the best, smart reader will also get to the point and understand the meaning of those word, and reader will  be able to imagine by themself, the scenery and background of the story happen at that time. The wonderful protagonist, the storyline will reveal it's own beauty as the reader  keep on going through the storyline. Finally yhe time will reveal itself whether it's good or bad story

Tl:dr - Read it if you want a goodlaugh and light hearted novel, Don't read it if you wanted a mature mc, and character development there's none.Yes I enjoyed this novel, but I'm disappointed in characters development, Bai Xiaochun is still childish even after 1000+ chapter, he is a coward and scaredly cat. I expected that after 500 or so chapters he will matured BUT NO! he still the same. and the plot is easily predictable and repetitive. That's why I'm disappointed maybe this novel is too light hearted for me. Nonetheless this is enjoyable if you don't care about changes and only care about easy going MC and comedy, just don't expect matured main protagonist, this is mediocre compared to other novels of Er Gen, I'm sorry.

Personally not a huge fan starts of strong to the late 900's then it's jaringly thrusts you our ofthe story and in my opinion quite a bit if not all consequences of anything the protagonist dues is simply a mute point in the grand scheme of things then complete falls apart at the endAt the end of the day greattranslation just want to slap the author for getting  me invested it is not worth the build up in the slightest I would honest recommend stopping at around 800 that's when it goes from acceptable to down right infuriating.

Great novel with a great translator! Sign me up for anything Er Gen + Deathblade.If you liked any of Er Gen's previous works, or any of his ongoing ones, definitely give this a go. More comedic than his earlier works and pretty much on-par with ISSTH (character and laughs-wise). Had me reading nonstop and legitimately laughing out loud countless times.Hmm, need 100 words for a review, so in addition: His MC is great with alchemy (well, eventually), but his learning progress leads to several....unforeseen situations. And some very creative (read: sneaky and arguably unscrupulous) ways to leverage his creations against opponents. May also play into his romantic life, but you'll have to read about it for yourself.Enjoy!

This is one of those bittersweet kind of novels.To start off, I'll say that I enjoyed reading the development of the story. Plotwise, the novel is not terrible; but neither is it an epic. As mentioned, the story development was quite good. You can easily see plot progression, and also find a lot of unexpectedly good plot twists - they just jump at you, but add certain value to the story development. Of course, there are some areas that also just fall flat, which kind of counterbalance a lot of the ultra plot twists.Story development aside. Where this novel fail hard for me...are the characters. Some of them are super bipolar, some are just ultra disgusting to think about, and very few are decent or likeable.Obviously people/characters have multiple faces/sides to them, but these characters will just randomly go from benefactors to degenerates and vice versa on a whim. Their thoughts and personalities feel like they are just being randomly thrown from an rng pool. Very few characters actually stick to their persona in this story.Unfortunately, the one person that does stick to their persona from beginning to end, is the MC... In other novels, this might or most always would be a good thing, because you at least know and can somewhat relate to the MC. But for this novel? This feature is a complete tragedy! It also irks when thinking about the name of the novel.The MC stays the same from beginning to end. Cowardly, childish, stupid, prone to be schemed against, forever does things and thinks that he's innocent, etc. His one redeeming quality is that he will somehow gain courage when it comes to saving those who are close to him. One of the things that disgusts me to no end, is the fact the MC doesn't know what pride or revenge even mean. Basically, the enemies can come and go as they please. This cowardly MC will only ever fight back when his figurative life flame is about to wink out. If he's not on the verge of death, he's like a punching bag - just a passive element in the story.Well that's how I feel about it, but to each their own. Clearly some people like it, so take this with a grain of salt.

This was one of those novels where I was holding off on reading, but in the end it was definitely worth every moment.Here's my ratings if you're interested.Character development: 9/10Character development was great. It's quite interesting following the development of the MC.  All the way from his mortal world.World development: 8/10...I wish there was moreStory devoplemnt: 9/10It's will take you on rollercoaster of emotions.Comdy: 9/10Had me laughing from beginning to end. Just make sure your not eating while you read or your food might grow wings.Overall great story build up. You learn to really like certain individuals, wish there more of others, and wish there was more developments to the story!

Great book. The MC is just Craaaazy!!!. I like his character (Broad minded + narrow minded at the same time) How?...Great read! totall worth your time. This novel is a legend COMEDY+CULTIVATION+TRAGEDY+AWESOME WORLD-BUILDING+SHINING ARCH ENEMIES+ A POSER MC....It has one of my favorite main characters to date. His fear of death and pain grounds him to reality and relatability. Extremely hilarious, funny, innocent and entertaining!!  In the beginning, the hero is very relatable (i understand the irony of this sentence), but as the story progresses, he is a typical xianxia hero. The other characters don't have that much of a development, but it doesn't matter. The comedy will pull you through the whole story.

Overrated, i dont get the people saying that this is unique compared to other chinese novels but its the same the only difference is that the mc is afraid to die compared to most mc where theyre so reckless and doesnt care about their life. The mc is basicaly just a mix of boastful, idiot, coward and a womanizer. I also dont get why sometimes the mc will be the coolest guy out there then after 5 chapters hes back to being a idiot. Also he doesnt want to die but for some reason likes to boast and show off bro if you dont want to die then stop boasting and showing off every goddamn second. The mc has to be the most childish, pathetic and idiotic mc i have ever seen. His level of arrogance is definetly on the same level as the young masters. Like seriously if youre afraid of death then just cultivate silently and stop your blabbing and flaunting  Unless you like arrogant young masters for some reason then dont read this.

Reasons to not read:1) Rampant sexism. Every single woman of any note is "shockingly beautiful," and every chapter that they show up in will include a mention of the fact that the main character thinks they're hot. With maybe three exceptions, the only times women are described as anything other than super hot, they're ugly and therefore a punchline.2) Homophobia. 410 chapters in and we finally meet the first gay character. He is of course explicitly evil, repeatedly referred to as a sex deviant, and tries to sexually assault the main character the moment they meet. And just to drive the point home, his boss is also an evil gay rapist.

This series starts off well but the MC never seems to get any more mature than the average 8 year old. After 300+ chapters, I couldn't take it anymore. review must have a 100 words. OK. the first few chapters try to build the MC has some sort of clever schemer but then stops. The next 300 chapters, the MC either runs away from every problem or brute forces it. So, not much of weasel at all really and more just a dumb dumb who stumble from one fortunate encounter to another. I grew to really hate him and was cheering the rabbit on. That was when I realized I was done with this series.

Main character is horrible. 300 chapters in and after dozens of years of cultivating, he's still immature like a kid. All he cares about is showing off and getting praised even when he didn't do anything. Evert time something he does messes up, he feels wronged that others want to attack him and get revenge while saying they're bullies. He never gets any character development or grows more mature. I honestly don't know how so  many people could enjoy this and make it overwhelmingly recommended. I don't recommend it unless you enjoy a mc who just likes showing off for no reason and is an immature kid.

Over-rated because of author's previous work. This novel story development is really nice and all but when it come to the MC development, its extremely disappointing when you see how even minor side character have better development as compare to MC. This is probably one of the few novel where I honestly think the MC deserve to be fully humiliated. MC does have extreme godplot rng where you think whats the point when he is a goddammit coward that doesn't even dare to do anything besides causing problems left and right. Extremely recommended to people that doesn't like mainstream MC and prefer an extremely coward and bragging MC that lived of extreme rng to survive.

The beginning is very good but it starts to get boring after afew hundred chapters. I finally gave up at chapter 800++, by then it was ridiculously boring and one sided, with nothing interesting to look forward to.I feel most of the positive reviews should be from readers who only read the first few hundred chapters or less, yes its still a good story at the start but by the time u reach 800 chapters u realise how boring, silly, repetitive and ridiculous the story has become.I suggest for u to read A record of a mortals journey to immortality, city of terror, the wandering inn, my girlfriend is a zombie

I need to buy gold VIP because I'm not too fond of the direction this novel is progressing. I skipped from the 100ish to the epilogue to check out the rumors, and hell, YES, the MC is still a manchild till the end. It's just a matter of personal preference, but I'll give this a negative review. It would serve to be an excellent daily dose of comedy. If I read this when it was ongoing, maybe I'll give it a thumb up; who knows? But to read it from the start after its finish? NAH, NEVER.note***Maybe I will come back if I have read all the other novels and can't deny the comedy category any longer, but if I want to wait until I read everything, it would be years.

Hare la review en mi idioma natal, solo puedo decir las siguientes cosa.Sigo esta clase de novelas desde hace mucho, voy para 18 años y comence la lectura a los 13 años, en este tiempo he leido y finalizado gran variedad de novelas y solo puedo decir, A will eternal; es esa clase de novela que si tienes un pesimo dia y no sabes que hacer, una simple lectura te alegra el dia. Esta novela me acompaño en momentos dificiles y me hizo madurar antes de tiempo, la primera que finalice fue Desolate Era, hace unos años y ahora me toca finalizar esta. Sin mas que decir, esta novela es lo maximo y sabe hacer un perfecto balance entre lo real y lo irreal, esas escenas en donde inmortales son humillados o "Son personas", son la esencia de esta novela y poco mas, la recomiendo al 100% con los ojos vendados. Y poco mas, esta novela tiene ese carisma que a todos nos encanta de parte de Er gen, y mas que decir. Espero futuro proyectos y gracias a todo el equipo de traduccion, gracias deathblade sama, y estoy al tanto de tu dia a dia y me hace feliz, que estes feliz, porque gracias a ti, pude experimentar la felicidad a travez de los escritos. Los amo a todos, y gracias por todo

Un prota molesto crecido al que nadie soporta y para colmo cobarde, las partes cómicas de lo novela son pocas al no ser que pienses que es cómico molestar a todos en la secta y que nadie lo quiera. La mayor pérdida de tiempo de mi vida en fin no la recomiendo, a los que si les gusta la novela no me malentiendan no digo que la novela en sí sea mala solo digo que no es el tipo de protagonista al que encuentre ni divertido ni agradable si tiene talento y es bueno en la creación de píldoras pero su personalidad deja mucho que desear
